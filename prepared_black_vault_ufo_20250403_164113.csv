"The Pentagon Says AATIP Wasnt About UFOsBut the Man Slated to Take It Over Ended Up Designing the Governments UAP Strategy";"2025-04-02";"neill tipton a newly released batch of documents obtained through the freedom of information act foia reveals that a senior pentagon officialidentified by luis elizondo as the person intended to take over the advanced aerospace threat identification program aatip later played a central role in classified uap briefings high level meetings and the creation of the pentagons ufo office known as aoimsg that office would ultimately evolve into what is now the all domain anomaly resolution office aaro this connection adds a new layer to the long running controversy surrounding aatip although elizondo has long maintained that the program investigated ufos and that he led it until his  resignation the pentagon has issued conflicting statementsat times denying both aatips focus on unidentified anomalous phenomena uap and elizondos leadership according to elizondo he had planned to transfer aatip to neill tipton a senior executive within the office of the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security ousd i s but that handoff elizondo says never materialized emails between elizondo and tipton previously leaked to and published in part by popular mechanics in  and later officially obtained and verified with additional emails revealed by the black vault via foia in  appear to partially support this claim in one message dated october   elizondo wrote to tipton i took the liberty of drafting a memo at the unclassified level that helps you better assume the new responsibilities for aatip continue scrolling for more memorandum drafted by luis elizondo transferring aatip to neill tipton yet despite the plan outlined in these emails and memo released via the foia tipton would never join the ranks of aatip nor would he lead the program according to elizondo neill got cold feet about taking my place at aatipsomething i wouldnt have expected from himand began to backpedal telling people people that he knew nothing about aatip its focus or my involvement elizondo said in his book imminent i was disappointed that my friend chose to do what he did especially given the vast amount of emails and witnesses who knew neill was slated to take over aatip when i left after elizondos retirement the department of defense frequently denied that elizondo ever had a role within aatip and repeatedly stated that the program did not have a focus on ufos but in what appeared to be an about face with at least part of their stance pentagon spokesperson christopher sherwood told the ny post in  aatip did pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena many rejoiced at the confirmation about what elizondo had already said for some time but the excitement about what many hoped to be a new era of transparency about aatip was short lived sherwoods statement was corrected seven months later by another pentagon spokesperson susan gough gough had taken over being the sole public affairs official speaking on the uap topic neither aatip nor aawsap were uap related gough wrote in a  e mail to the black vault the purpose of aatip was to investigate foreign advanced aerospace weapons system applications with future technology projections over the next  years and to create a center of expertise on advanced aerospace technologies when asked about the discrepancy between her statement and sherwoods gough stated to the black vault at the time mr sherwood was repeating the information that had been provided by a previous spokesperson some two years earlier she continued that previous spokesperson is no longer with my organization and i cannot comment on why that persons explanation of aatip included that it had looked at anomalous events according to all the official information i have now when implemented aatip did not pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena that was not part of the technical studies nor the reports produced by the program the previous spokesperson no longer with the dod that gough referred to was lt col audricia harris who stated to researcher roger glassel in  that aatip had researched anomalous events such as sightings of aerodynamic vehicles engaged in extreme maneuvers with unique phenomenology reported by u s navy pilots or other credible sources according to gough sherwood simply translated this previous statement as aatip pursued uaps during their research and issued his statement to the ny post erroneously finally in  all of that was seemingly changed yet again when the pentagon released another statement claiming that in developing the reports and exploring how to create a center of expertise the aatip contract allowed for research drawn from a wide variety of sources including reports of uaps however the examination of uap observations was not the purpose of aatip despite this constantly shifting position by the dod this new foia release on april   in response to a  request filed by the black vault contains multiple email threads and internal communications placing tipton at the center of uap planning and strategizing in  and  in a july   email to senior dod officials tipton described a high level uap briefing to the senate select committee on intelligence ssci and senate armed services committee sasc noting that  senators attendedan unusually high turnout that was nearly unprecedented for an engagement like thisand that continued very high interest from the senate was evident he confirmed his direct participation in the briefing alongside representatives from odni the navy the air force and norad just months later tipton was involved in the establishment of the airborne object identification and management synchronization group aoimsg the office stood up by the pentagon following the dissolution of the uap task force in a november   email tipton confirmed that deputy secretary of defense kathleen hicks had signed the aoimsg stand up memo and stated that his team was already working implementation direction these details paint a complex picture although tipton never assumed leadership of aatip as elizondo intended his later prominence in classified uap briefings and the establishment of the pentagons ufo infrastructure raises new questionsespecially given the pentagons earlier denials that aatip had anything to do with ufos in other words why tipton out of everyone else within the dods massive infrastructure of people within it for critics of elizondos narrative the pentagons  and  statements denying his leadership role or aatips uap focus seemed definitive but the trajectory of tiptonnamed by elizondo as the intended recipient of aatip responsibilitiessuggests the subject matter was in fact deemed serious enough to warrant his engagement through classified briefings organizational leadership and strategic planning when it came to uaps the departments own documents now confirm that tipton himself hosted an asd level meeting on uap issues helped develop a dod collection and analysis strategy and participated in drafting the framework for a technical roadmap according to september  internal correspondence released in this foia case while elizondo has faced scrutiny over the exact nature of his role even by the black vault these documents show that his intended successor was not only involved in uap discussionsbut instrumental in advancing them the pentagon has yet to publicly reconcile these apparent contradictions this foia release represents just one more piece of a broader puzzle still being put together more documents and records may further clarify howand by whomthe pentagons ufo investigations were managed in the years leading to the formation of aaro and as this never before told chapter continues to unfold the black vault will publish all additional records that may surface in the future numerous foia

"The UFO Whistleblower, Congress, and Classified Briefings: New DoD OIG Emails And What They Reveal";"2025-04-01";"randolph r stone assistant inspector general for evaluations of space intelligence engineering and oversight a series of internal department of defense office of inspector general dod oig emails referencing ufo whistleblower david grusch were released under the freedom of information act foia following a request filed by the black vault the request processed under case dodoig   sought all emailsincluding attachmentssent to or from randolph r stone the assistant inspector general for evaluations of space intelligence engineering and oversight that contained the keyword grusch from january   through to the date of processing in mid  the released documents pages in totaloffer a limited but interesting window into the awareness and handling of grusch related matters within the dod oig particularly as interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena uaps surged in congress and the media on november   an internal email thread within the department of defense office of inspector general dod oig was initiated under the subject line heads up contact with uap interviewees the message originated from an individual within the space missile and nuclear evaluations division part of the evaluations component of the oig the full content of that initial message is entirely redacted under foia exemption b  offering no insight into what was originally communicated however it prompted a reply from another oig staff member later that same day stating grusch reached out to me thursday evening continue scrolling for more further into the correspondence an exchange dated june   shows david grusch emailing a dod oig staff member and copying randolph stone stating please see jwics dni ig is requesting any records produced from my  jul  interview with you and your staff while grusch refers to the dni ig there is no known office of inspector general within the office of the director of national intelligence odni it is more likely that grusch was referring to the inspector general of the intelligence community ic ig rather than a dni ig which does not formally exist the ic ig is an independent oversight entity established under the intelligence authorization act for fiscal year  and while it operates within the office of the director of national intelligence odni it serves a broader mission by providing oversight across all  elements of the u s intelligence community referring to it as the dni ig implies an internal inspector general specific to the odni which is not the case the ic ig is the proper entity for handling whistleblower complaints and likely the office grusch intended to reference in his communication stone forwarded this message to colleagues with a brief fysa for your situational awareness but he provided no additional commentary by september   the senate armed services committee sasc had begun making inquiries about grusch as noted in an email where a dod oig legislative affairs staffer stated the sasc reached out to ask if we have any information on an nga employee named dave grusch the office of the inspector general responded by reviewing internal records to assist with potential congressional oversight multiple messages from september  further show that grusch was mentioned in relation to a classified report on uaps that the house committee on oversight and accountability hcoa was requesting to review the committee staff expressed a desire to hold a classified meeting and noted that the committee is interested in learning about mr david grusch the messages from late september show logistical planning and concern over clearances including questions from stone such as how can we confirm that the staffers have the proper clearance ts sci i dont want a spill highlighting the sensitivity of the information and the classified nature of the uap related report in july  just days before the house oversight committees hearing featuring grusch as a witness internal emails within the dod oig revealed that stone was not invited to the hearing responding to a colleague asking if he was going with i wasnt invited the response to that simply stated thats good with a redacted line of additional commentary the public and political spotlight on grusch intensified as news networks and even local reporters began reaching out to the dod oig on july   a reporter from komo tv in seattle emailed stone asking for comment can you comment on the status of these investigations are you willing to testify before congress in upcoming uap hearings no direct response is included in the released material also among the documents is a september   email from dr sean kirkpatrick then director of the department of defenses all domain anomaly resolution office aaro sent directly to stone while the message itself is completely redacted under foia exemption b  which protects deliberative communications within the government its presence in a release focused on david grusch suggests it may have pertained to internal discussions about uap related matters or gruschs claims along with the ic ig the emails subject one important note was the fact that kirkpatricks email had contents of this email are deliberative process privileged and fall under foia exemption b  within the footer while this exemption does permit agencies to withhold predecisional and deliberative materials to protect internal discussions its application is not absolute under the foia improvement act of  agencies must demonstrate that releasing the information would cause foreseeable harm to the interests protected by the exemption simply labeling an email as deliberative or citing b  is not sufficient justification to withhold it in full courts have consistently held that exemption claims must be accompanied by a specific and reasoned explanation of the harm that would result from disclosure in this case kirkpatricks blanket statement does not on its own justify full redaction under the law and the lack of any segregable content raises questions about whether the exemption was appropriately applied moreover it is the responsibility of foia release authorities not the sender or a disclaimer in the footer of an email that determines whether a record qualifies for withholding under the law the black vault has appealed this and other aspects of these denials and redactions see other emails released from dr kirkpatrick not withheld under foia exemption b  and released to the black vault some of which holding the same exact footer line there is also correspondence from october   referencing a planned member level classified briefing on uaps for the house oversight committee it was confirmed that some members have gone down and looked at the report ahead of time and while the focus was stated to be on the uap report the same email hinted the briefing team should be prepared for additional lines of questioninglikely involving grusch what they should be prepared for is entirely redacted while the documents are heavily redacted in parts and provide limited insight into the substance of gruschs allegations or the conclusions of any investigative actions they do confirm internal dod oig awareness of and engagement with grusch as early as mid  the emails also reflect the congressional and media interest that escalated throughout  and  as grusch became more publicly vocal about his claims the foia response noted the redactions were made under exemptions b  for deliberative processes b  for personal privacy and b  e for law enforcement techniques and procedures the black vault has filed an appeal to argue these redactions";"Government

"FOIA-Released Emails Mention Alleged Triangular UAP Photo Former UAP Task Force Director Speaks Out";"2025-02-26";"newly released documents obtained by the black vault through the freedom of information act foia under case  f  reveal email exchanges within the department of defense dod discussing a photograph reportedly showing a triangular unidentified aerial phenomenon uap emerging from the ocean the foia request was originally filed in december  along with these documents john jay stratton former director of the unidentified aerial phenomena task force uaptf has now spoken exclusively to the black vault about this claim offering brand new clarification that no such photograph depicting a triangular craft emerging from the ocean was ever received by the uaptf screen shot of the debriefs article in  the long rumored photograph in question gained significant attention following a december  article by the debrief which described an extremely clear image of a large triangular object with rounded edges and white spherical lights in each corner according to the article the photograph was allegedly taken in  by an f a  fighter pilot after the object emerged from the ocean and ascended vertically the story quickly became one of the most talked about pieces of evidence that the dod was allegedly withholding with references by public figures such as luis elizondo which fueled widespread discussion across social media the foia released emails dated december  and   show internal communication within the dod discussing the debrief article in one email addressed to susan gough her name is redacted in the to line but not in the body of the email someone name redacted from the deputy chief of naval operations dcno office states jay stratton tells me the photo is part of the active investigation so it would probably be withheld from release for that reason continue scrolling for more the information in this email which was conveyed to gough in  from stratton himself appeared to confirm the existence of the triangle uap photograph however strattons recent statement to the black vault directly addresses this assumption john jay stratton an office of naval intelligence senior analyst from the nimitz operational intelligence center and former director of the uap task force at the time of this email exchange the story in the debrief and the claim that an f a  pilot had provided a photograph of a triangle emerging from the ocean i was handling multiple cases when asked about it especially on an unclassified system i was aware of what the debrief was reporting while also managing other investigations some of which could have been conflated with this claim we had photographs from f a  pilots instances of uap that appeared triangular pyramidal and other unrelated cases given the circumstances i was limited in what i could discuss at the time stratton explained he added to prevent years of speculation and misinterpretation of emails taken out of context i want to clarify explicitly no such photo was ever provided to us by an f a  pilot showing a triangle emerging from the water this statement is simply meant to ensure accuracy on this specific detail not to challenge or critique the debriefs reporting tim mcmillan the author of the debriefs original article provided additional context to the black vault in  the idea that the u s government was formally investigating uap was still shocking the information reported including the description of some images came from multiple sources with direct access to early uaptf intelligence documents i remain confident in the accuracy of the information shared mcmillan further elaborated that the early uaptf intelligence reports were widely distributed among dod component branches federal agencies and allied intelligence services according to mcmillan the sourcing for the fast movers article was robust involving individuals who had no prior involvement in the ufo topic but were stunned to see official government briefings on uap mcmillan added the information reported in the fastmovers article including the description of some images early assessments and interest in transmedium uap came from multiple sources that had direct access to these early uaptf intelligence documents im sure a lot of people assumed these sources were the usual ufo suspects e g lue elizondo chris mellon etc however that couldnt be further from the truth in fact im not even sure mellon or elizondo even knew about those intel documents prior to my article that article had some expert sourcing however it all came from people who had no involvement or interest in uap prior or since they were primarily willing to talk because it was the first time theyd ever seen anything related to ufos uap being distributed through official channels and they were stunned rumors have long circulated on social media since  when the alleged photo was first published by the debrief in this example a completely unrelated photo was misrepresented in order to add legitimacy to their headline since the publication of the debriefs article the rumored triangular uap photograph has remained a focal point of discussion within the ufo community however strattons latest comments suggest these claims are based on misinterpretations when asked why he did not correct the record at the time stratton stated keep in mind thats an email on an unclassified system i dont recall if i corrected it on a separate system at the time but generally there was no formal process for publicly addressing inaccuracies related to potentially classified reporting engaging with speculative reporting was neither standard practice nor always feasible other notable documents in the  page foia release available below include extensive media inquiries regarding the roles of aatip and aawsap with several journalists questioning the involvement of luis elizondo and clarifications sought about navy reporting protocols on uap sightings emails also discuss inquiries into claims related to the drake equation and its connection to aatip highlighting broader speculation about extraterrestrial life considerations correspondence shows ongoing questions about the legitimacy of various reports dods reluctance to engage publicly on speculative stories and repeated efforts by the media to confirm details about classified briefings and uap related photographs while the newly released documents and strattons statement seemingly dispel one of the most persistent rumors surrounding uap

"Pentagon Releases AARO Report on Go Fast Video Analysis";"2025-02-10";"the department of defenses all domain anomaly resolution office aaro has released a new report analyzing the well known go fast video which first appeared publicly in  the report dated february   provides an in depth assessment of the unidentified object captured in the  video and concludes that the object exhibited no anomalous flight characteristics the go fast video was originally recorded by a u s navy f a f super hornet off the coast of florida in january  the footage taken using the jets forward looking infrared flir sensor appeared to show a small fast moving object traveling just above the oceans surface when the department of defense officially released the video in  it quickly became one of three widely publicized uap videos that fueled public and congressional interest in military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena according to aaros report which is based on a technical analysis of the available footage the objects actual altitude was approximately   feet rather than near the oceans surface as originally assumed the report also estimates the objects speed to be between  mph and  mph depending on wind conditions with aaro asserting that it was moving with the wind and displayed no indications of propulsion or maneuverability inconsistent with atmospheric phenomena continue scrolling for more aaro assesses with high confidence that the object did not move at anomalous speeds the report states the objects apparent high speed is attributable to motion parallax an optical effect that induces an observer to perceive that a stationary or slow moving object is moving much faster than its actual speed when viewed from a moving frame of reference motion parallax is a well documented phenomenon that can cause misinterpretations of aerial footage particularly when captured from fast moving military aircraft the aaro analysis incorporated historical wind data from the time and location of the encounter showing that at   feet winds were blowing at approximately  mph from the west their assessment found that the objects speed when adjusted for wind influence was within a range consistent with that of a small airborne object such as a balloon or drone aaro also addressed data limitations in the report noting that the analysis relied on a compressed version of the video due to the loss of the original file and metadata without complete flight telemetry from the f a f aaro had to account for a range of possible aircraft headings in its calculations despite these constraints the agency maintains confidence in its assessment that the object did not demonstrate any extraordinary flight capabilities the release of the aaro report has sparked a range of reactions from those who have followed the case skeptics of the extraterrestrial hypothesis have pointed to the findings as further evidence that the go fast object was likely mundane in origin mick west a well known investigator of uap footage has long argued that the object was most likely a balloon and has stated that aaros findings align with his own analysis however others remain unconvinced some researchers argue that the dods methodology lacks transparency particularly given the absence of the original metadata former navy pilot ryan graves who has spoken extensively about encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena believes broader questions remain about the navys uap encounters overall the conclusions drawn in the recent aaro report align with statements made by dr jon kosloski director of the all domain anomaly resolution office during his testimony to congress in november  at that time dr kosloski explained that the object in the go fast video was not as close to the water as it appeared stating through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water but is rather closer to   feet he attributed the objects extraordinary appearance to the parallax effect describing it as a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight the go fast video along with the gimbal and flir tic tac videos has played a major role in the increased scrutiny of uaps over the past decade the footage first surfaced in  through the new york times and to the stars academy of arts science an organization co founded by former blink  musician tom delonge at the time the release of these videos marked an unprecedented public acknowledgment of military encounters with unidentified objects since then congressional hearings and government reports have continued to fuel debates over the nature and origin of these phenomena";"Government Report";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/pentagon-releases-aaro-report-on-go-fast-video-analysis/";"754";"Neutral"

sightings the department of defense dod through its office of inspector general oig launched project no d devsn   on may   aimed at evaluating how the dod has managed reports and investigations related to uaps this evaluation became a focal point for many as it promised to shed light on the dods approach to these phenomena in response to a freedom of information act foia request filed by the

partially redacted offer a glimpse into that evaluation late september  setting the stage the first significant exchange occurred in late september  when a dod oig official initiated contact with key players in the office of naval intelligence oni and the office of the under secretary of defense for intelligence and security ousd i s the purpose of this outreach was to gather points of contact and arrange briefings on the dods efforts related to uaps the oig was particularly interested in the classified annex of the senate armed services committee report on the national defense authorization act for fy  which dealt with advanced operational capabilities collection exploitation and research in one of the early emails an official wrote my leadership and i would like to obtain a briefing on the unexplained airborne activities and understand the current efforts and programs in place early october  coordination and planning by early october the planning for these briefings began to take shape on october   matthew c cummings the deputy director for technical collection at ousd i s confirmed his willingness to support the briefing noting that the navy typically took the lead on briefing program activities and status im happy to fill in any gaps from the osd level he added indicating a collaborative effort across departments discussions quickly moved to logistics with emails exchanged about scheduling and the security clearances required for attendees an email from october   highlighted the need for participants to have ic blue badges a requirement reflecting the high level of classified information that would be discussed we all have our ic blue badges so we are good to go said one unidentified individual from the igs office ensuring that the necessary security protocols were in place mid october  the briefing takes place as the date of the briefing approached final preparations were made the briefing was scheduled for october   in a secure conference room at the pentagon the dod oig was keen to ensure that the briefing provided the most comprehensive information available requesting we would like to receive the briefing at the highest classification available we want to make sure that we are not limited in the information we receive the meeting itself while not detailed in the released emails likely involved in depth discussions on the classified aspects of uap investigations and the dods response strategies another email of note made reference to a recorded approximate  minute duration classified uap briefing created by stratton although this has been discovered before the length of that video was unknown until now post briefing follow up following the october  briefing the email correspondence reveals continued coordination among the involved parties the oig remained engaged ensuring that any further information or clarification needed for their evaluation would be obtained this foia release marks the first interim disclosure of

"Transcript: Dr. Jon Kosloski, Director, AARO, Media Roundtable on the FY24 Consolidated Annual Report on UAP  November 14, 2024";"2024-11-18";"staff for those who havent met me i am sue gough from the defense press operations in the osd office of the secretary assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs we are here today to hear what doctor jon kosloski the new director of the all domain anomaly resolution office has to say about aaros activities and the release today of the unclassified version of their annual report on unidentified anomalous phenomena as required by by statute im going to in a moment ill turn it over to dr kosloski to provide opening remarks then we will go to q a i will be moderating and calling on you because dr kosloski is this is his first time with you all we would appreciate it if you would identify yourself by name and outlet when you ask your question please keep it to one question and one follow up and as we if we have more time i will circle back we have about  minutes all right dr kosloski dr jon kosloski thanks sue good morning im dr jon kosloski director of the all domain anomaly resolution office or aaro its a pleasure to be here today to introduce myself and to provide an update of the work of our office as you know i assumed the aaro directorship in august following more than two decades at the national security agency where i did advanced research in the areas of optics computing and crypto mathematics continue scrolling for more by nature im drawn to tough scientific problems which is what brought me to aaro and the uap mission unidentified objects in any domain pose potential threats to safety and security reports of unidentified anomalous phenomenon particularly near national security sites must be treated seriously and investigated with scientific rigor by the u s government since becoming director ive been extremely pleased by aaros team and the framework theyve established for rigorous analysis of uap reports aaro has taken meaningful steps to improve data collection and retention bolster sensor development effectively triage uap reports and reduce the stigma of reporting a uap event in the coming year aaro will prioritize building partnerships promoting increased transparency and scaling up the work of the office this week the department delivered its fiscal year  consolidated annual report on uap and had the opportunity to brief congressional staff on the reports findings as of today over   uap reports  of which im sorry aaro has received over   uap reports over  of which came to aaro during the period covered by the report aaro has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons birds drones satellites and aircraft meanwhile over  reports lack sufficient data for scientific data for analysis and are retained in our active archive these cases may be reopened and resolved should additional information emerge to support analysis i want to emphasize that although only a very small percentage of reports to aaro are potentially anomalous these are the cases that require significant time resources and a focused scientific inquiry by aaro and its partners it is also important to underscore that to date aaro has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings activity or technology none of the cases resolved by aaro have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies it is also worth noting that aaro continues to see a geographic bias of uap reports near u s military assets and sensors however this bias has been mitigated somewhat by an increase in commercial pilot reporting in the continental united states aaro is working closely with the services to implement existing reporting guidance while expanding uap reporting to more of the interagency meanwhile aaro continues to review the u s historical record relating to uap and will release a second volume of its congressionally directed historical record report we welcome any former or current government civilian contractor or military service member with relevant information to reach out to us at www aaro mil for every uap report operational or historical aaro will follow the science and data wherever they lead and we are committed to sharing as much information as possible at the unclassified level to inform the public of our activities and findings with that ill take your questions staff brandi q thanks thank you so much for doing this im brandi vincent with defense scoop one question on the report and then a follow up it noted that the next step for gremlin the gremlin capability is conducting a  day pattern of life collection at a national security site where is that going to be how did you pick that location and what ultimately are you guys trying to accomplish with that dr kosloski so its currently deployed wed rather not say exactly where it is because we want it to be an unbiased test and dont want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system we chose that specific location because of the environment we expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that were going to see and there had been uap reports in that general area and were trying to build a baseline so right now we have this geographic bias where we are getting reports near the national security sites but we also have a bias from pilots and other security personnel so we want to have a better understanding of what normal looks like near those national security sites and then eventually well be expanding our baseline investigations to other areas in the u s to look at what normal looks like away from national security sites q and then after the hearing on the hill yesterday lawmakers were saying that they are really keen to meet in a scif with aaro officials other dod officials whistleblowers and members of congress is that something youve been approached about have done or are open to doing dr kosloski so were absolutely open to meeting with everybody weve been meeting with a variety of folks from whistleblowers through staffers and we encourage anybody with direct information to come to us go to our secure reporting mechanism on the website and when we get that well reach out to them schedule a meeting in the scif and congress has enabled us to receive all sensitive information regardless of classification or ndas they may have signed and we receive that information and we follow up on every tip that they provide us q thank you dr kosloski yes staff oren q two questions one i was wondering if you could talk about whether any analysis or data of reports you have received has led you to the foreign adversary conclusion specifically the uass  reports of uass spotted near nuclear facilities and then i was wondering if you could just talk about the the the effort to increase engagement with foreign partners for a better a broader array of sensors data analysis information dr kosloski sure so firstly no we have not been able to correlate any uap activity to adversarial collection activities or advanced technologies i also want to make it clear that uap covers a lot of potential activity by its very nature the definition is in the name right so its unidentified and its anomalous once we know that its a uav or a uas of some nature we then hand that responsibility off to one of our partners so langley being a great example it was known to be uav activity so we were there in a supporting role but it was not our responsibility to address that so those investigations are conducted by somebody else and were focusing on the truly anomalous where we dont understand the activity and then for the foreign engagement were working on increasing our foreign engagement we recognize that uap is not just going to be a domestic issue the office has focused primarily on u s government and were going to be growing to public reporting soon in  and were going to be growing our international partnerships hopefully also in  so starting with the group that we have the most familiar familiarity with and then growing that from there q are there any specific countries you can name in terms of who you aim to work with dr kosloski we are going to be starting with the traditional allies of the dod and the ic and ill leave it at that for now until we have those partnerships well established and then well probably come out with more information yes staff yes nick q nick schifrin pbs newshour thanks very much for doing this this may be basic and silly but i just want to read you a quotation from the hearing yesterday and have you respond to it this is luis elizondo former dod official let me be clear uap are real advanced technologies not made by our government or any other government are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe the u s is in possession of uap technologies as are some of our adversaries can you just give us a sense of your perspective on that quotation dr kosloski break that down so theres a lot in that quotation firstly absolutely agree uap are real we as i said weve received   cases a large number of those are unresolved which means we dont know exactly what they are until we know what they are or who they belong to we cant attribute intent and understand exactly what the purpose of that phenomenon is so were not comfortable we at aaro are not comfortable saying at this time whether or not the uap are there to collect information or not in regards to whether or not aaro u s government or any other government has uap we have not found any evidence of that at this time q but the bottom line conclusion remains what you said at the top there is no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial activity dr kosloski we have not found any no there are definitely anomalies we have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial staff phil q just to follow up on that dr kosloski yes q you know a lot of people read that or saw just that hearing you know when you said there was no breakthrough technologies i mean the person seems to be suggesting that you know at a minimum these are breakthrough technologies what leads you to assume that the ones that the uap cases that you cant resolve are not potentially breakthrough technologies or is it that you just havent been able to conclusively decide either way dr kosloski thats exactly right so we dont fully understand the phenomenon enough to say whether or not its a breakthrough technology or not so its a very small percentage of our overall cases that after the initial analysis still have the anomalous characteristics that one could attribute breakthrough technologies to its less than   of our cases and were still studying those with our ic and s t partners trying to understand what technologies could be used to provide those characteristics but we dont understand them well enough to say whether its a breakthrough technology a misunderstanding of the sensor performance or something else q and a skeptic might say that you know if you just because you cant explain it isnt a reason to assume that its not a breakthrough technology or i mean by the definition of breakthrough technology would be something that you dont have if you dont have it you cant explain right dr kosloski agree  so were not ruling it out were open to that as an explanation for it but were just not attributing breakthrough technology as the explanation to it were an open mind works both ways so if we dont understand what it is we cant say that it is or is not a breakthrough technology so were just trying to keep an open mind q got it its not a catch  dr kosloski right q inaudible ok dr kosloski yes it we accept that the explanation could be a misunderstanding of ours in interpreting the data or it could be a breakthrough technology until we understand we dont know q thank you brad dress for the hill have you found anything that might be a breakthrough technology i know youre saying you dont know if there are breakthroughs yet but something that might be a breakthrough technology near the military sites some of those sightings youve seen near the military sites have you found anything that might be that or are they all just been drones and uas dr kosloski its definitely not all just drones and uas so we have several particularly interesting cases were working on within the office working with our partners to downgrade several of those cases so we can talk about them publicly but there are interesting cases that i with my physics and engineering background and time in the ic i do not understand and i dont know anybody else who understands them either q but those near military sites and facilities dr kosloski until we get the information approved for release id rather not say where those sightings were but definitely interesting sightings q ok thank you tanya nori with newsnation can you please speak to aaros involvement in investigating incidents of drone or uap uav incursions at the u s southern border with mexico dr kosloski so we im not that familiar with any specific investigations that we have that aaro has supported for uap or sorry uas uav activity near the southern border we have had several uap cases that have been brought to us that were near the border that weve investigated i believe that we have resolved the cases that have been brought to us and were working on downgrading those so that we can share those q and do you can you speak to the procedures that are in place for border patrol agents to report ufo sightings and how are those reports handled and investigated by the pentagon overall and by aaro specifically dr kosloski so at this time i dont believe we have a formal mechanism for border patrol to report to aaro right now the only formal mechanism is through the dod and were working on expanding that across the government through the interagency and for public reporting we expect that formally to be in place hopefully in  right now were getting those cases more through partnerships that those folks have with dod or counterintelligence members staff luis q hi luis martinez with abc news thank you for doing this and welcome dr kosloski thank you for coming q yes i would like to follow up on that earlier question about incidents you cannot explain based on your you know broad experience a couple of follow ups on that please were these all within the last year were these all at the same location were you looking at video evidence or what are the metrics that youre looking at that you cannot explain dr kosloski great question so of the cases that im thinking of theres a variety of them the cases that are top of my mind are spread out over the last year and a half im sure that theres some other anomalous ones a little further back but the ones that im particularly most interested in are the last year and a half there is some video footage for a few of the cases not all of the cases so its not just eyewitnesses but in each of the cases im particularly interested in there were multiple eyewitnesses and there is additional data to go with them it remains to be seen whether or not that additional data is going to be sufficient for us to either resolve the case understand whether its a uav bird or balloon or say something substantive about the nature of the unknown phenomenon so were still trying to understand whether or not theres more data available because we get the data that comes in from the witnesses but we also go through a bunch of other sources whether or not we can enrich the data that was brought to us and then build a better case still digging into it q what are some of the characteristics or are there is there a trend among these things and are they extended period incidents or are they very very quick dr kosloski in each of these cases they were not extended the cases that im thinking of there was no commonality across the different cases different morphologies so orbs cylinders triangles in one of the cases it has been happening over an extended period of time and it is possible that theres multiple things happening there could be some uav activity in the environment thats getting confused or conflated with the uap activity so were trying to tease that out right now q just to clarify earlier you said langley was uavs this who the langley incidents would not be among what youre describing dr kosloski correct q ok dr kosloski correct staff konstantin q thanks konstantin toropin with military com so one of the sort of key criticisms i think around this issue from the hearing yesterday was government transparency lack of government transparency i mean can you sort of speak to that critique and whether you feel that aaro is being overly secretive if you guys are working on being more transparent sort of address this criticism from the hill that you guys are emblematic of a government that overtly classifies everything and dr kosloski yes yes its an understandable concern and im going to make a comment my wife would like me to share more about the uap incidents too but ill i guess its on the record now so laughter the fundamental issue is that aaro receives cases from our partners and in most cases to date because weve been working through the services those partners are providing data that is gathered from sensitive platforms and we need to make sure that we are protecting sensitive sources and methods not introducing vulnerabilities to their operations so even though that theres nothing inherently classified about the existence of a uap we have to protect that information when aaro receives those interesting cases the cases that were just briefly talking about we try to identify if the uap information can be isolated from the sensitive usually its metadata that identifies characteristics of the platform and we work to downgrade that material as much as we can but we cant do it unilaterally it has to be in partnership with the folks that brought that information that is a very deliberate process as you can imagine to make sure that were not releasing sensitive information so we have taken significant steps to speed that up weve hired a number of declassification experts were going to be hosting a declassification workshop so we can make sure were implementing best practices from across the dod and the ic all of that takes more time than i think the public would like for it to take but aaro is working on it we recognize that the types of cases that i was just talking about are from my perspective true anomalies and were going to need significant scientific rigor to address those and yes the u s government has a lot of nice scientists little bias there but were going to need the help of academia and the public to address some of these so we need to build that more transparent partnership q and just to follow up sort of on the flip side you know is there any as you look at cases to release for example you talked about how at least one of the interesting ones is sort of ongoing is there a world where you hold back release out of fear of drawing more reports you know sort of drawing attention to a location and getting copycats or you know what have you sort of muddying the data dr kosloski yes so that concern has been raised to us because bad data in gets bad analysis out however no data in gets no analysis out and so being an nsa guy im a firm believer in big data is going to lead to better conclusions and i would rather have to filter out some of those copycat cases but have more substantive data if were looking for a needle in a haystack id rather have multiple haystacks to go digging through rather than just one q thank you staff brandi q just one quick follow up dr kosloski yes q im sorry if ive missed it before but what is aaro or your definition for breakthrough technology dr kosloski so lots of people lots of organizations have different definitions and the definition the working definition that weve been using informally inside of our office and we are working on more formal definitions for the different domains for space the air domain and the undersea domain but the general definition is beyond state of the art today and beyond where we think that we could get in the next couple years so we keep an eye on the capabilities of ourselves our partners and everyone else at the academic and the very technical level and then if its beyond that then we would say thats a breakthrough technology staff phil q just a quick follow up on your answer to konstantin dr kosloski yes q so if you need to i mean i guess a lot of americans have this view of the government as kind of all knowing and being able to ascertain you know everything particularly when they think of nsa and other agencies dr kosloski if only q and so i guess if you could help us explain to readers you know what is it about these phenomena that that you know reach the limits of government of the understanding of the professionals in the government and why it would be necessary to bring in academics thatd be helpful for us dr kosloski great question so following on brandis question if its a breakthrough technology by its very nature we dont know how it would be done right if we knew how to do it wed be doing it already and it wouldnt be a breakthrough technology and so usually those breakthroughs are coming from the academics historically either in science or engineering the breakthroughs come from academia and then they go into industry and then they come into government the governments employing a lot of scientists like myself and others who understand a fair amount about the science but being able to extend that to something that we could not have imagined when we were in school or when we were in training is a very difficult process and so were going to have to pull in those folks that they spend all day every day just thinking of what is the next possible thing that you could do if you were just to tweak the equations a little bit this way or change the material a little bit that way and the government because of our day jobs we dont get to spend all day every day doing that as much as i would like to staff nick q just two small clarification so the what you called interesting cases at the beginning and then luis asked you more specific spread out over the last year and a half just to be clear those are cases that we dont know about right meaning we have not read about these cases that youre speaking about dr kosloski correct correct q you said to luis one of the cases has been happening over extended period of time i think konstantin said ongoing just to be clear that is ongoing or you just or was it just happening over extended period of time and youre not saying whether its extended or not dr kosloski extended period of time it may be ongoing but we dont know if the current activity is just drone activity in the environment and so were trying to follow up on that we had put more energy into it earlier on something flared up and now were checking on it q ok q ellie cbs just a follow up on the interesting cases are the interesting cases that youre talking about the  cases that merit further analysis or are they part of the active archive dr kosloski theyre part of the  yes that merit so the active archive just so that were clear those are cases where we dont have enough scientific data to continue the analysis were always looking for more and then when we do well pull those into the merit more analysis yes staff luis q last years report in the time frame had  new i believe incidents now you have  what do we owe this really large increase to dr kosloski so i just the new incidents i think to be clear this it had  q in your report here you talk about a total of  you know in the period of the reporting period dr kosloski yes q of which  were from this year and then the remainder were from previous dr kosloski oh yes yes q but then in last years report which was from and im looking at my notes here dr kosloski why the ramp up in reporting q yes i mean an additional  i mean in the same reporting period dr kosloski yes engagement q right dr kosloski so were we have the genadmin out were engaged with the services were engaging more with the services helping them understand what qualifies as a uap how to report it and were getting more reports of the anomalous activity its not that theres we dont believe that theres necessarily more anomalous activity its just were getting greater greater reporting and we expect as we continue that engagement with the services but also across the ic and the rest of the government to the question earlier were going to see that reporting go up as well were going to follow that with education campaigns so that for example the faa is providing us reports now as well so were getting reports from the pilots some of the reports from the pilots are starlink flares so light glinting off of satellites at just the right time of the evening it looks interesting and potentially anomalous but we can model that and we can show pilots what that anomaly looks like so that that doesnt get reported to us necessarily so were going to follow up the engagement campaigns with education campaigns so that as were increasing the number of accounts that come to us were not just getting more of the noise and trying to keep it focused on the interesting staff oren q just a very quick question on the active archive do you have an instance or instances where you have gotten more information for an event in the active archive and have pulled it out or is that dr kosloski thank you for asking we do yes laughter yes we do so it actually was the instance that im most familiar with was a starlink instance so we had several folks over the period i think it was multiple months where were seeing interesting activity in the sky and we found that when we because were continuously looking back at that active archive and looking for correlations across those incidents but also new incidents coming in we found some of those correlations in time the direction that they were looking and the location and we were able to assess that they were all in those cases looking at starlink flares yes staff inaudible q how many people work in your office dr kosloski we have several dozen folks working in the office but the power of the office isnt the number of people who work in it its our partnerships across the ic and the dod and hopefully in the near future academia as well staff luis q in the historical report from earlier this year there was mentioned that in the s and s as pilots started commercial pilots started flying they saw reflections as well off of what were like u  aircraft at that time so this new starlink seems to be very reminiscent of that thats dr kosloski yes very reminiscent yes q so youre seeing an uptick in that that might be again a historical parallel right dr kosloski yes and we do see some trends in the morphologies that are reported so for a while we were seeing a lot more balloons and then pilots started understanding what some of the space trash looked like and now were seeing as the mega satellite constellations are increasing starlink and theres others that are going up were seeing an increase in those lights in the sky that look very unusual as those satellites are deploying and we expect that that trend will also go down eventually yes staff ellie q i have to ask a broadcast specific question but do you anticipate releasing any video related to any of the cases that were ruled out or that are still unexplained dr kosloski so were going to be we have some resolved cases that are of public interest that have been talked about publicly that will be releasing on the th i think those are going to come with videos yes and then as we downgrade information the hope is that we will be able to release as much of that content as we can to the public so that we can get help in resolving them yes staff mosheh q thanks for doing this mosheh gaines with nbc you said earlier that there wasnt evidence that the uap activity was linked to foreign adversaries but im wondering have you seen any kind of suggestion that foreign adversaries have been trying to capitalize off of this with disinformation or anything else dr kosloski we have not but i am concerned that somebody could use the potential stigma to and take advantage of that if there is a stigma associated with reporting uap then thats an opportunity for the adversary to maybe conduct collection operations and not have folks report on it but we havent seen evidence of that yet staff weve got time for one more question anybody have one inaudible q so can you speak to any historic incidents like the phoenix lights incident in the s which many who claimed to have been a witness to the event feel the government has never taken seriously dr kosloski so we take those incidents very seriously and were going to be releasing some analysis in the upcoming volume ii historical report in the next few months where we were able to resolve a number of historic cases there are quite a few cases of public interest where we have resource limitations either we cant get enough technical data from back in the case of the phoenix theres lots of video and we can were still working on that i was actually having a conversation with somebody earlier this morning about additional data we can get for the phoenix case but in a lot of the historic cases were going looking for film and the film has been recycled or destroyed because its too expensive to retain and so were going to museums and all of that takes a lot of manpower at the same time were trying to resolve these other interesting cases that are coming in continuously these   cases that we have so were trying to balance those but the historical report thats coming out will have some of those that you had asked about staff all right folks thank you very much dr kosloski thank you very much q thank you follow the black vault on social media";"Government

"Navy Blocks Release of UAP Photos Amid Capitol Hill Hearing on Government Secrecy";"2024-11-14";"the u s navy has formally denied access to  documents containing photos marked as unidentified aerial anomalous phenomena uap the denial issued yesterday in response to a foia request filed by the black vault in  and given case number don navy   highlights the navys continued use of national defense and intelligence exemptions to keep uap data classified the response arrived less than an hour before a highly anticipated uap hearing on capitol hill where members of congress heard testimony about the governments lack of transparency on the issue journalist michael shellenberger holds up redacted uap task force briefing documents first obtained by the black vault the hearing titled unidentified anomalous phenomena exposing the truth was led yesterday by chairwoman nancy mace and congressman glenn grothman heads of various congressional subcommittees on cybersecurity government innovation and national security this marked the second time congress has convened specifically on uap matters with the hearing aimed at addressing the classified veil surrounding government held uap data the witness panel included navy rear admiral dr tim gallaudet former department of defense official luis elizondo nasa associate administrator michael gold and journalist michael shellenberger each expressed concerns about the dods ongoing reluctance to disclose uap information the navys response to the foia request ironically timed alongside the capitol hill session raises significant questions about the scope and depth of information kept from public scrutiny continue scrolling for more according to the response letter  documents were located following a search conducted by the deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare opnav n n after the completion of the search reads the letter it was determined that these documents are exempt in their entirety from disclosure under foia  u s c  specifically under exemption b  and in accordance with the uap security classification guide   unidentified aerial phenomenon uap security classification guide id   naval intelligence activity the use of exemption b  and the uap classification guide signals the navys position that these photos or photo bearing documents represent materials that could impact national defense or foreign policy if disclosed exemption b  covers information properly and currently classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy as specified by executive order  which protects military operations intelligence methods and national security infrastructure according to the navy the  denied documents align with executive order criteria such as a operations and military plans weapons systems and operations set forth by the command c intelligence activities intelligence sources or methods or cryptology and g vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems installations infrastructures projects plans or protection services related to national security as such none of the responsive records are being released and the public along with the media will remain in the dark on the true nature and specifics of this imagery the black vaults recent request for navy held uap photographs stemmed from a small array of previous foia requests which began in april  those requests filed to different offices in the navy sought videos of uap incidents the case ultimately wound up at the office of the chief of naval operations n n and in  they issued a complete denial declaring that all requested uap videos were classified and therefore exempt from release this disclosure represented a landmark confirmation at the time the u s navy not only holds an untold number of unreleased uap videos the navy would not confirm how many but acknowledges that the material is so sensitive it must be shielded entirely from public view the secrecy surrounding the uap issue has strengthened ever since and this newest denial is yet another testament to that reality the current foia request filed in september  expanded on that string of foia cases to specifically cover uap related photographs the navys latest response suggests that uap photos like their video counterparts remain tightly controlled to this day the uap security classification guide also cited in the denial was first obtained in redacted form by the black vault in december  it serves as the department of defenses blueprint for classifying uap information and has since april  when it was first signed by former director of naval intelligence activity nia scott bray the uap security classification guide scg is heavily redacted fully shielding from the public view how and what they classify about uap as described in the guide these data categories are intended to limit access to information that could expose military vulnerabilities or reveal intelligence sources and methods the guide has been a central component in the navys consistent denials under foia effectively preventing any direct visual evidence from reaching the public with the denial of the at least  photos the guide remains at the heart of ongoing transparency concernsa fact underlined during yesterdays uap hearing itself where the witnesses repeatedly pointed to excessive classification as a barrier to public understanding the withheld photos whether representing simple stills or part of broader compilations like presentations constitute a minimum of  visuals however each document could theoretically contain multiple images possibly escalating the volume of uap evidence the navy possesses but withholds this releaseor lack thereofhighlights the tension between government agencies and a growing demand for openness from congress the media and the american public for those invested in transparency this denial underscores a critical issue as long as the navy adheres to national security exemptions in foia cases and cites the uap classification guide in justifying these refusals a complete understanding of the uap phenomena will remain hidden the timing of this denial reinforces that despite congressional efforts to expose the truth the navys commitment to secrecy around uap data is far from waning an appeal has been filed by the black vault foia response letter follow the black vault on social media";"Government Report,

the navy which should have totaled  pages as noted in release  above however the navy responded stating nasa supplied only  pages an appeal has been filed extreme acceleration by uaps event one particular revelation from the above release was the discovery of an october   virtual event with the title extreme acceleration by uaps it was said to be a presentation given by robert powell founder of the scientific coalition for uap studies scu along with christopher mellon former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence delivering introductory remarks at first glance it appeared to may be just an event held by scu and michael gold former associate administrator for space policy and partnerships was sent an unsolicited invitation however at closer glance you can see that gold received the invitation from a rich coleman and in the signature line he signed it as the president of the unidentified aerial phenomena association gold then sent it to randy cruz senior advisor to the nasa administrator saying i just got this but fyi if youre interested in attending when researching this unidentified aerial phenomena association group nothing is really found that connects to this group online nor are there any references to it however richard coleman along with alexandra hale who also appeared in the signature block as the vice president of the group do run an organization known as the space transportation association sta with the same titles according to their website the sta is dedicated to supporting policies that advance robust affordable space transportation for nasa dod and commercial markets there is no contact information on stas website but the black vault reached out to powell and mellon for comment on the  event according to powell this was not a public event in addition he said there were  people at the presentation but declined to name any who attended nor would confirm if they were from the government or military the only information he gave on the attendees was that they were not from the world of ufology when mellon was asked by the black vault for comment only minimal information was received in return the first response was that his plans changed insinuating that he did not attend the event he also called the document a nothing burger the black vault followed up to confirm that he definitely did not attend and if the introductory remarks were given by someone else but mellon only responded with not ringing a bell powell was asked to confirm mellons attendance but declined to answer nasa was also asked by the black vault on whether their personnel attended on official business but they declined to comment stating that gold cruz and nasa director at the time james bridenstine no longer were at the agency and they would need to be contacted directly for confirmation attempts were made to contact the three individuals but as of the writing of this article no responses were received christy hansen

"AATIP Memo Unveiled After FOIA Battle: DoD Inconsistencies Exposed";"2024-08-23";"note and update     p pacific time hours after the publication of this article the pentagon responded with comment the article has been updated to reflect those answers which are added in blue luis elizondo after years of bureaucratic obstacles and inconsistent responses the black vault has obtained a highly sought after document through the freedom of information act foia that directly references the advanced aerospace threat identification program aatip reported since  as the pentagons secret search for ufos the draft memo never before seen by the public and authored by former dod counterintelligence agent luis elizondo details aatips mission as focusing on beyond next generation technologies in the areas of lift propulsion cloaking and human effects and describes how aatip was gathering information on unexplained or unknown aerial systems from various dod components and elements but more importantly to some it may even confirm elizondos official work within the program a claim denied by the pentagon since  continue scrolling for more neill tipton the journey to obtain these records began on may   when the black vault filed foia case  f  the request specifically sought communications between elizondo and neill tipton a senior dod official that was also one of three named individuals in elizondos dod inspector general ig complaint filed on may   this complaint alleged that all three tipton pentagon spokesperson susan gough and former director for defense intelligence intelligence and security garry reid conducted retribution and provided false information to the public and were also accused by elizondo of abusing government authority and illegal destruction of information this complaint stemmed from elizondos belief that he was being mistreated after his resignation from the pentagon due to his decision to speak about his time investigating ufos now being referred to as unidentified anomalous phenomena uap after amending the foia request to focus only on emails between elizondo and tipton containing keywords such as unidentified aatip and uap and others in response to the dods request to narrow the search scope the dod initially replied in december  stating that no records were found a portion of the original foia response from december   which stated that no records could be found as requested believing differently the black vault filed an appeal within one day asserting that responsive documents existed this assertion was based on knowledge gained from various sources and research means during the timeframe leading up to the case filing the information learned through this process combined with the specific keywords provided for the foia request along with the date range requested for the search   left little to no doubt that responsive records existed september   at  a mr luis elizondo sent an e mail to mr neill tipton which included the aatip acronym in the body the appeal stated this fact alone should have yielded at least one responsive document to the request which was used as the basis of the appeal the appeal letter filed by the black vault went on to further express deep frustration with the foia process the dod and their handling of cases related to aatip and elizondo stating let me add within the body of this appeal on how frustrating some of these requests are getting i believe and hope your office has seen the lengths ive gone to try and make your efforts easier by closing withdrawing requests to reduce paperwork etc i am also always there when possible to amend requests to also lessen the burden of a workload however as you can see with this case alone and now many others cases are having me reduce the scope to help but after months and sometimes years of waiting they are inappropriately closed and i have to then go through the lengthy appeal process there are numerous agencies that i can cite where requests are processed for communications between two people without stipulating a keyword search i am sure a keyword reduction in scope helps but as we can see here that is likely creating more problems generating more paperwork and wasting more time than it is actually helping the appeal was also ccd electronically to the office of government information services ogis which acts as a mediator between foia requesters and federal agencies helping to resolve disputes and ensure proper handling of foia requests the appeal was ultimately granted in february  and the case was remanded back to the dod for further processing despite this the black vault never received an acknowledgment that the case had been reopened as required by law when the black vault inquired about the status in august  a year and a half after the case should have been reopened and acknowledged the dod responded that an acknowledgment letter had not been sent as it was overlooked although it was then sent that day and the case was renumbered as  fr  due to the remand there was no estimated date of completion given in a puzzling sequence of events that followed the documents related to foia case  fr  were later allegedly released on march   but yet again the black vault never received that correspondence either and no explanation was given as to why that was by the writing of this article the results of that case once the documents were finally received just this week in a moment for an unknown reason the dod redacted a reference to aatip in may  which appeared in a letter that had already long been in the public domain further to that the exemption cited that justified the redaction through foia which is known as the deliberative process exemption b  seemed to be legally questionable but first it turned out that the same documents requested in  fr  happened to turn up and were released in may  under foia case  f  but they had extensive redactions this case was originally filed by the black vault in june  these redactions included the complete blacking out of a crucial memo on aatip which was attached to one of the emails written by elizondo that was released in that case in addition another reference to aatip in one of the emails was also mysteriously redacted even though it had already been published unofficially and was available in the public domain through elizondos ig complaint about  years prior and a portion of the same referenced in popular mechanics another  years prior to that these actions further complicated the dods already questionable handling of these types of requests the dod had claimed foias deliberative process exemption known as b  to justify the redactions of aatip related material despite some of it already being available in the public domain for years from a legal standpoint the black vault felt none of these actions were justified and an appeal was filed as of the writing of this article that appeal remains open this was all reported by the black vault on may   now back to foia case  fr  this week sparked by the release of elizondos new book imminent which contains numerous references to tipton a follow up was sent by the black vault regarding foia case  fr  to check on the status although no explanation was given the same day the follow up was sent the foia case officer emailed the final foia response letter that was dated march   nearly  months ago an email thread between elizondo and tipton about responsibilities for aatip being transferred between the two gentlemen which mysteriously had redactions lifted contrary to foia case  f  and the aatip memo that the black vault was fighting for through appeal on foia case  f  which now appeared nearly entirely unredacted the documents which were first denied by the dod to even exist three years ago were now found as of the writing of this article no explanation as to either why the dod never found them or why they were not truthful in their  response to the black vault has been given  fr  release of the aatip memo release on march   received august    f  release of the aatip memo released and received may   this aatip memo never before seen by the public until now was originally drafted in  by elizondo in hopes that it would be later issued by then deputy secretary of defense depsecdef patrick m shanahan it confirms the existence of aatip and the scope of the program the memo states that aatip was a program with a strategic focus on beyond next generation technologies in the areas of lift propulsion cloaking and human effects and sought unexplained or unknown aerial systems information from all dod elements for the purposes of intelligence analysis and exploitation the memo states that the dod continues to consider aatip a priority especially given recent advancements with unmanned aerial surveillance uas platforms that are becoming widely available further to that it states that ousdi has a demonstrated interest for any and all reporting involving anomalous uas threats and it goes on to order that all dod elements are hereby required to provide a courtesy copy of any data and information obtained from the field that related to unexplained or unknown aerial systems to the director of defense intelligence for technical collection and special programs that position was held by neill tipton and this memorandum if officially issued by the depsecdef department wide would ultimately make tiptons desk the central point of information related to aatip once information was received from dod elements although it does not reference uap or ufos specifically the mention of unexplained or unknown aerial systems and anomalous uas threats makes it the first official dod document of its kind to connect aatip to such a mission investigating unexplained objects in addition to giving a rundown of aatips scope and mission the existence of this memo may also directly contradict the dods ongoing assertions that elizondo had no official role in the program this has been a claim by the pentagon that has fueled much controversy that has lasted for years could the revelations within the memo have played a role in why the dod wanted to deny the memos existence three years ago or was this truly an administrative oversight and the documents were simply overlooked similar to how the dod failed to send an acknowledgement letter once the case was remanded back to them that sought it in the first place regardless of why this memo was not discovered and denied to exist in  it likely wont settle the debate about elizondos claimed leadership of aatip or the stated objectives of aatip once and for all for some this memo will absolutely be viewed as a pivotal piece of evidence in the ongoing debate over aatips scope and elizondos involvement to them this will serve as undeniable proof if they even felt undeniable proof wasnt already out there to begin with to others the release of this may simply be seen as a draft memorandum that was authored by elizondo without definitively proving his leadership or directorship of a funded ufo program known as aatip and in the end to them it will prove nothing this juxtaposition is a true testament to the divide between skeptics and believers in todays conversation about the ufo topic but even as early as just days ago the dod still continues to deny elizondos official involvement in aatip a claim elizondo still strongly disputes however that was prior to the dod releasing and the public seeing this memorandum so the black vault reached out to the pentagon for comment how does this not contradict the dods stance on luis elizondo and the denial of his official responsibilities on aatip why would he be drafting such a memorandum if aatip had long been cancelled per dod and that he had no official responsibilities on it per dod the first question asked after publication of this article pentagon spokesperson susan gough submitted comment by stating luis elizondo had no assigned responsibilities for aatip as noted in the historical record report volume  available on www aaro mil aatip was never an official recognized dod program the draft unsigned memo for the record that you reference was crafted by mr elizondo and appears to have been unsolicited given the opportunity to respond to the above elizondo added the memo they claim was unsolicited was in fact a request by none other than the secretarys front office staff not only is the dod spokesperson wrong but any due diligence on their part would have illustrated this this is yet another sad attempt to once again deceive the american people by a select few in the pentagons pao unfortunately this type of behavior conducted by a few bad faith individuals only further damages the credibility of an organization who has very little credibility left to offer the sad truth is that this type of behavior reflects poorly on the entire pentagon including the majority who are patriotic loyal and selfless fortunately the truth always comes out as it always has per the official document release luis elizondo notated that the draft memorandum was created per the front office guidance to both he and neill tipton in response tipton never expressed disagreement with that assertion or questioned why elizondo was submitting an unsolicited memorandum as the dod public affairs has labeled it rather tipton appeared to be expecting it and was going to return thoughts once he read it per his october   email above this was followed up by why would the dod tell me this memo didnt exist but i later would be successful getting it after an appeal from the same office that denied it existed in the first place after publication of this article pentagon spokesperson susan gough submitted comment by stating as indicated in the response letter to you dated december   regarding  f  the initial foia search did not yield responsive records given the opportunity to respond to the above elizondo added this response isnt even worthy or a response its clear that obfuscation and deceit is the new norm for the same few at the pao office i would once again remind them that propaganda and disinformation against the american public is illegal elizondo also provided the following written statement to the black vault about this release which underscores his thoughts about the importance of it all thanks to the black vaults continued pursuit of the facts the dod had no choice but to relent and admit the obvious  aatip was a real program and funded  my former employer the ousd i has had and currently has a keen interest in aatip and the uap topic  there remains a clear national security nexus as it relates to uap my fear is that unless more people demand the truth this information which many of us already knew would never see the light of day and remain hidden from the public an excellent example of the black vault not taking no for an answer as the controversy surrounding aatip will undoubtedly continue the black vault remains committed to bringing the truth to light whatever that may be despite the challenges posed by the dods problematic foia
