"The Pentagon Says AATIP Wasnt About UFOsBut the Man Slated to Take It Over Ended Up Designing the Governments UAP Strategy";"2025-04-02";"Neill Tipton A newly released batch of documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), reveals that a senior Pentagon officialidentified by Luis Elizondo as the person intended to take over the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP)later played a central role in classified UAP briefings, high-level meetings, and the creation of the Pentagons UFO office known as AOIMSG. That office would ultimately evolve into what is now the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This connection adds a new layer to the long-running controversy surrounding AATIP. Although Elizondo has long maintained that the program investigated UFOs and that he led it until his 2017 resignation, the Pentagon has issued conflicting statementsat times denying both AATIPs focus on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) and Elizondos leadership. According to Elizondo, he had planned to transfer AATIP to Neill Tipton, a senior executive within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (OUSD[I&S]). But that handoff, Elizondo says, never materialized. Emails between Elizondo and Tipton, previously leaked to and published in part by Popular Mechanics in 2020, and later officially obtained and verified with additional emails revealed by The Black Vault via FOIA in 2024, appear to partially support this claim. In one message dated October 3, 2017, Elizondo wrote to Tipton, I took the liberty of drafting a memo at the Unclassified level that helps you better assume the new responsibilities for AATIP.Continue scrolling for more... Memorandum drafted by Luis Elizondo transferring AATIP to Neill Tipton Yet, despite the plan outlined in these emails and memo released via the FOIA, Tipton would never join the ranks of AATIP, nor would he lead the program, according to Elizondo. Neill got cold feet about taking my place at AATIPsomething I wouldnt have expected from himand began to backpedal, telling people people that he knew nothing about AATIP, its focus, or my involvement, Elizondo said in his book Imminent. I was disappointed that my friend chose to do what he did, especially given the vast amount of emails and witnesses who knew Neill was slated to take over AATIP when I left. After Elizondos retirement, the Department of Defense frequently denied that Elizondo ever had a role within AATIP, and repeatedly stated that the program did not have a focus on UFOs. But, in what appeared to be an about face with at least part of their stance, Pentagon spokesperson Christopher Sherwood told the NY Post in 2019, AATIP did pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena. Many rejoiced at the confirmation about what Elizondo had already said for some time, but the excitement about what many hoped to be a new era of transparency about AATIP was short-lived. Sherwoods statement was corrected seven months later by another Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough. Gough had taken over being the sole public affairs official speaking on the UAP topic. Neither AATIP nor AAWSAP were UAP related, Gough wrote in a 2019 e-mail to The Black Vault. The purpose of AATIP was to investigate foreign advanced aerospace weapons system applications with future technology projections over the next 40 years, and to create a center of expertise on advanced aerospace technologies. When asked about the discrepancy between her statement and Sherwoods, Gough stated to The Black Vault, At the time, Mr. Sherwood was repeating the information that had been provided by a previous spokesperson some two years earlier. She continued, That previous spokesperson is no longer with my organization, and I cannot comment on why that persons explanation of AATIP included that it had looked at anomalous events. According to all the official information I have now, when implemented, AATIP did not pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena that was not part of the technical studies nor the reports produced by the program. The previous spokesperson no longer with the DoD that Gough referred to, was Lt. Col. Audricia Harris, who stated to researcher Roger Glassel in 2018 that AATIP had researched anomalous events (such as sightings of aerodynamic vehicles engaged in extreme maneuvers, with unique phenomenology, reported by U.S. Navy pilots or other credible sources). According to Gough, Sherwood simply translated this previous statement as AATIP pursued UAPs during their research, and issued his statement to the NY Post erroneously. Finally in 2021, all of that was seemingly changed yet again when the Pentagon released another statement claiming that, In developing the reports and exploring how to create a center of expertise, the [AATIP] contract allowed for research drawn from a wide variety of sources, including reports of UAPs. However, the examination of UAP observations was not the purpose of AATIP. Despite this constantly shifting position by the DoD, this new FOIA release on April 1, 2025, in response to a 2022 request filed by The Black Vault, contains multiple email threads and internal communications placing Tipton at the center of UAP planning and strategizing in 2021 and 2022. In a July 13, 2021, email to senior DoD officials, Tipton described a high-level UAP briefing to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) and Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), noting that 28 senators attendedan unusually high turnout that was nearly unprecedented for an engagement like thisand that continued very high interest from the Senate was evident. He confirmed his direct participation in the briefing, alongside representatives from ODNI, the Navy, the Air Force, and NORAD. Just months later, Tipton was involved in the establishment of the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG), the office stood up by the Pentagon following the dissolution of the UAP Task Force. In a November 23, 2021, email, Tipton confirmed that Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks had signed the AOIMSG stand-up memo and stated that his team was already working implementation direction. These details paint a complex picture. Although Tipton never assumed leadership of AATIP, as Elizondo intended, his later prominence in classified UAP briefings and the establishment of the Pentagons UFO infrastructure raises new questionsespecially given the Pentagons earlier denials that AATIP had anything to do with UFOs. In other words, why Tipton out of everyone else within the DoDs massive infrastructure of people within it? For critics of Elizondos narrative, the Pentagons 2018 and 2019 statements denying his leadership role or AATIPs UAP focus seemed definitive. But the trajectory of Tiptonnamed by Elizondo as the intended recipient of AATIP responsibilitiessuggests the subject matter was, in fact, deemed serious enough to warrant his engagement through classified briefings, organizational leadership, and strategic planning when it came to UAPs. The Departments own documents now confirm that Tipton himself hosted an ASD-level meeting on UAP issues helped develop a DoD Collection and Analysis Strategy  and participated in drafting the framework for a Technical Roadmap, according to September 2021 internal correspondence released in this FOIA case. While Elizondo has faced scrutiny over the exact nature of his role, even by The Black Vault, these documents show that his intended successor was not only involved in UAP discussionsbut instrumental in advancing them. The Pentagon has yet to publicly reconcile these apparent contradictions. This FOIA release represents just one more piece of a broader puzzle still being put together. More documents and records may further clarify howand by whomthe Pentagons UFO investigations were managed in the years leading to the formation of AARO. And as this never-before-told chapter continues to unfold, The Black Vault will publish all additional records that may surface in the future. Numerous FOIA requests remain outstanding. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/the-pentagon-says-aatip-wasnt-about-ufos-but-the-man-slated-to-take-it-over-ended-up-designing-the-governments-uap-strategy/"
"The UFO Whistleblower, Congress, and Classified Briefings: New DoD OIG Emails And What They Reveal";"2025-04-01";"Randolph R. Stone Assistant Inspector General for Evaluations of Space, Intelligence, Engineering and Oversight A series of internal Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) emails referencing UFO Whistleblower David Grusch were released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) following a request filed by The Black Vault. The request, processed under case DODOIG-2024-000451, sought all emailsincluding attachmentssent to or from Randolph R. Stone, the Assistant Inspector General for Evaluations of Space, Intelligence, Engineering and Oversight, that contained the keyword GRUSCH from January 20, 2021, through to the date of processing in mid-2024. The released documents75 pages in totaloffer a limited but interesting window into the awareness and handling of Grusch-related matters within the DoD OIG, particularly as interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) surged in Congress and the media. On November 1, 2021, an internal email thread within the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General (DoD OIG) was initiated under the subject line Heads up: Contact with UAP interviewees. The message originated from an individual within the Space, Missile and Nuclear Evaluations division, part of the Evaluations Component of the OIG. The full content of that initial message is entirely redacted under FOIA exemption (b)(5), offering no insight into what was originally communicated. However, it prompted a reply from another OIG staff member later that same day, stating, Grusch reached out to me Thursday evening.Continue scrolling for more... Further into the correspondence, an exchange dated June 27, 2022, shows David Grusch emailing a DoD OIG staff member and copying Randolph Stone, stating: Please see JWICS. DNI IG is requesting any records produced from my 12 Jul 2021 interview with you and your staff. While Grusch refers to the DNI IG, there is no known Office of Inspector General within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). It is more likely that Grusch was referring to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community (IC IG), rather than a DNI IG, which does not formally exist. The IC IG is an independent oversight entity established under the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, and while it operates within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), it serves a broader mission by providing oversight across all 18 elements of the U.S. Intelligence Community. Referring to it as the DNI IG implies an internal inspector general specific to the ODNI, which is not the case. The IC IG is the proper entity for handling whistleblower complaints and likely the office Grusch intended to reference in his communication. Stone forwarded this message to colleagues with a brief FYSA (For Your Situational Awareness), but he provided no additional commentary. By September 1, 2022, the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) had begun making inquiries about Grusch, as noted in an email where a DoD OIG Legislative Affairs staffer stated: The SASC reached out to ask if we have any information on an NGA employee named Dave Grusch. The Office of the Inspector General responded by reviewing internal records to assist with potential congressional oversight. Multiple messages from September 2023 further show that Grusch was mentioned in relation to a classified report on UAPs that the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability (HCOA) was requesting to review. The committee staff expressed a desire to hold a classified meeting and noted that the Committee is interested in learning about Mr. David Grusch. The messages from late September show logistical planning and concern over clearances, including questions from Stone such as, how can we confirm that the staffers have the proper clearance (TS/SCI)?  I dont want a spill!!! highlighting the sensitivity of the information and the classified nature of the UAP-related report. In July 2023, just days before the House Oversight Committees hearing featuring Grusch as a witness, internal emails within the DoD OIG revealed that Stone was not invited to the hearing, responding to a colleague asking if he was going with, I wasnt invited. The response to that simply stated, Thats good, with a redacted line of additional commentary. The public and political spotlight on Grusch intensified as news networks and even local reporters began reaching out to the DoD OIG. On July 30, 2023, a reporter from KOMO4 TV in Seattle emailed Stone asking for comment: Can you comment on the status of these investigations? Are you willing to testify before Congress in upcoming UAP hearings? No direct response is included in the released material. Also among the documents is a September 12, 2023, email from Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, then director of the Department of Defenses All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), sent directly to Stone. While the message itself is completely redacted under FOIA exemption (b)(5), which protects deliberative communications within the government, its presence in a release focused on David Grusch suggests it may have pertained to internal discussions about UAP-related matters or Gruschs claims, along with the IC IG (the emails subject). One important note was the fact that Kirkpatricks email had contents of this email are deliberative process privileged and fall under FOIA exemption (b)(5) within the footer. While this exemption does permit agencies to withhold predecisional and deliberative materials to protect internal discussions, its application is not absolute. Under the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, agencies must demonstrate that releasing the information would cause foreseeable harm to the interests protected by the exemption. Simply labeling an email as deliberative or citing (b)(5) is not sufficient justification to withhold it in full. Courts have consistently held that exemption claims must be accompanied by a specific and reasoned explanation of the harm that would result from disclosure. In this case, Kirkpatricks blanket statement does not, on its own, justify full redaction under the law, and the lack of any segregable content raises questions about whether the exemption was appropriately applied. Moreover, it is the responsibility of FOIA release authorities  not the sender or a disclaimer in the footer of an email  that determines whether a record qualifies for withholding under the law. The Black Vault has appealed this, and other, aspects of these denials and redactions. (See other emails released from Dr. Kirkpatrick not withheld under FOIA exemption (b)(5), and released to the Black Vault, some of which holding the same exact footer line.) There is also correspondence from October 19, 2023, referencing a planned member-level classified briefing on UAPs for the House Oversight Committee. It was confirmed that some Members have gone down and looked at [the report]ahead of time, and while the focus was stated to be on the UAP report, the same email hinted the briefing team should be prepared for additional lines of questioninglikely involving Grusch. What they should be prepared for is entirely redacted. While the documents are heavily redacted in parts and provide limited insight into the substance of Gruschs allegations or the conclusions of any investigative actions, they do confirm internal DoD OIG awareness of and engagement with Grusch as early as mid-2021. The emails also reflect the congressional and media interest that escalated throughout 2022 and 2023 as Grusch became more publicly vocal about his claims. The FOIA response noted the redactions were made under exemptions (b)(5) for deliberative processes, (b)(6) for personal privacy, and (b)(7)(E) for law enforcement techniques and procedures. The Black Vault has filed an appeal to argue these redactions.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/the-ufo-whistleblower-congress-and-classified-briefings-new-dod-oig-emails-and-what-they-reveal/"
"DoD Report Says Aguadilla UFO Was Just Sky Lanterns Previous Scientific Studies Claim Otherwise";"2025-03-20";"The Department of Defenses All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has released a new assessment of the 2013 Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) event, concluding that the objects recorded on infrared video did not demonstrate anomalous flight characteristics and were likely sky lanterns. The incident, recorded by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aircraft on April 26, 2013, has been widely analyzed since the footage was made public.

According to AAROs March 20, 2025, case resolution report, the video actually depicts two objects traveling near each other rather than a single object splitting apart. The agency stated that a reconstruction of the event using Systems Toolkit (STK) modeling determined that the objects drifted at approximately 8 mph, consistent with wind speed at the time.

AAROs analysis determined that what appeared to be transmedium behaviormeaning the objects seemed to enter and exit the waterwas instead a result of the infrared sensors limitations. The report explains that thermal crossover, a phenomenon in which an objects heat signature blends with the background, caused the objects to appear to vanish when they reached the ocean. The objects did not enter the water. Rather, the sensor could not distinguish the objects from their environment due to a lack of thermal contrast between them and the ocean, the report notes. AARO also assessed with moderate confidence that the objects were sky lanterns, commonly released by resorts and hotels in the area during celebrations. The report points to the objects size, thermal signature variability, and drifting motion as supporting this conclusion. SCU Report Contradicts Findings The Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU), an independent research group, previously conducted an in-depth analysis of the Aguadilla video, reaching a different conclusion. Their study, which examined frame-by-frame infrared data and radar information, suggested that the object displayed speeds exceeding 100 mph and transmedium capabilities. SCU researchers argue that no known aircraft, balloon, or natural phenomenon accounts for the observed behavior. For further details on SCUs findings, visit their report here. Despite their previous findings, SCU stated in November that they contacted AARO for their findings on the Aguadilla case, but were told it was going through the pre-publication process. Now that it is available, it appears based on the above post SCU is open to evaluating AAROs findings. Any updates from them will be posted by The Black Vault. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/dod-report-says-aguadilla-ufo-was-just-sky-lanterns-previous-scientific-studies-claim-otherwise/"
"The DoD Inspector General Complaint of Luis Elizondo: A Document Archive";"2025-03-18";"Luis Elizondo, October, 2017 In May 2021, Luis Elizondo, a former Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence officer who has claimed to be the former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) and investigated UFOs for the Pentagon, submitted a formal complaint to the DoD Inspector General (DoD IG). The complaint alleged misconduct, coordinated disinformation, and whistleblower retaliation by senior Pentagon officials, including the former Director of Defense Intelligence for Intelligence and Security (DDIIS), Garry Reid, Public Affairs Officer Susan Gough, and former Director for Defense Intelligence, Collection and Special Programs Neill Tipton. Elizondos complaint sought an official DoD IG inquiry into what he described as malicious activities, coordinated disinformation, professional misconduct, whistleblower reprisal and explicit threats. According to his complaint, these actions not only misrepresented his work within the DoD but also sought to undermine his credibility following his departure from government service. The complaint, which has since been previously published in redacted form by the NY Post, includes a detailed chronology of Elizondos alleged involvement in AATIP, his interactions with senior defense officials, and what he characterizes as a broader effort to suppress information on UAP. Elizondo stated in the complaint that attempts to clear the record by some senior officials, serving as witnesses to this abuse, have been ignored by certain elements within the Office of the Secretary of Defense. He further alleged that actions taken against him directly erode the very foundation of national security ethos and the public trust instilled by the American people. The Black Vault has pursued multiple Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to uncover records related to Elizondos complaint and the DoDs handling of the allegations. These efforts have resulted in the release of various documents, including a heavily redacted transcript of an interview with Elizondo, as well as internal correspondence about the UAP investigation emails obtained via FOIA that reference the DoDs internal UAP evaluation efforts, including discussions about Elizondos claims and the Pentagons public messaging strategy and two additional FOIA cases released in March 2025 that shed new light on internal deliberations regarding Elizondos allegations.Continue scrolling for more... Among the most notable revelations from the FOIA releases are details about the DoD IGs handling of the complaint. Internal correspondence indicates that the DoD IG assigned multiple case numbers to different aspects of Elizondos complaint. Some cases were forwarded to the Directorate for Investigations of Senior Officials, while others were categorized under whistleblower reprisal investigations. Emails reveal internal discussions on how the DoD should respond to media inquiries regarding Elizondos involvement in AATIP, with indications that officials sought to discredit his role or diminish the importance of the program. The Black Vault continues to pursue additional FOIA requests related to Elizondos complaint and the broader DoD approach to UAP transparency. With each release, more details emerge about how Elizondos allegations were handled internally and how the Pentagon sought to manage both internal and external narratives surrounding UAP research.

"FOIA-Released Emails Mention Alleged Triangular UAP Photo Former UAP Task Force Director Speaks Out";"2025-02-26";"Newly released documents obtained by The Black Vault through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) under case 21-F-0299 reveal email exchanges within the Department of Defense (DoD) discussing a photograph reportedly showing a triangular Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) emerging from the ocean. The FOIA request was originally filed in December 2020. Along with these documents, John Jay Stratton, former Director of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF), has now spoken exclusively to The Black Vault about this claim, offering brand-new clarification that no such photograph depicting a triangular craft emerging from the ocean was ever received by the UAPTF. Screen shot of The Debriefs article in 2020 The long-rumored photograph in question gained significant attention following a December 2020 article by The Debrief, which described an extremely clear image of a large triangular object with rounded edges and white spherical lights in each corner. According to the article, the photograph was allegedly taken in 2019 by an F/A-18 fighter pilot after the object emerged from the ocean and ascended vertically. The story quickly became one of the most talked-about pieces of evidence that the DoD was allegedly withholding, with references by public figures such as Luis Elizondo which fueled widespread discussion across social media. The FOIA-released emails, dated December 3 and 4, 2020, show internal communication within the DoD discussing The Debrief article. In one email addressed to Susan Gough (her name is redacted in the to: line but not in the body of the email), someone (name redacted) from the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (DCNO) office states, Jay [Stratton] tells me the photo is part of the active investigation, so it would probably be withheld from release for that reason.Continue scrolling for more... The information in this email, which was conveyed to Gough in 2020 from Stratton himself, appeared to confirm the existence of the triangle UAP photograph, however, Strattons recent statement to The Black Vault directly addresses this assumption. John Jay Stratton, an Office of Naval Intelligence Senior Analyst from the Nimitz Operational Intelligence Center and former Director of the UAP Task Force At the time of this email exchange, the story in The Debrief, and the claim that an F/A-18 pilot had provided a photograph of a triangle emerging from the ocean, I was handling multiple cases. When asked about it, especially on an unclassified system, I was aware of what The Debrief was reporting while also managing other investigations, some of which could have been conflated with this claim. We had photographs from F/A-18 pilots, instances of UAP that appeared triangular/pyramidal, and other unrelated cases. Given the circumstances, I was limited in what I could discuss at the time, Stratton explained. He added: To prevent years of speculation and misinterpretation of emails taken out of context, I want to clarify explicitly: No such photo was ever provided to us by an F/A-18 pilot showing a triangle emerging from the water. This statement is simply meant to ensure accuracy on this specific detail, not to challenge or critique The Debriefs reporting. Tim McMillan, the author of The Debriefs original article, provided additional context to The Black Vault: In 2020, the idea that the U.S. government was formally investigating UAP was still shocking. The information reported, including the description of some images, came from multiple sources with direct access to early UAPTF intelligence documents. I remain confident in the accuracy of the information shared. McMillan further elaborated that the early UAPTF intelligence reports were widely distributed among DoD component branches, federal agencies, and allied intelligence services. According to McMillan, the sourcing for the Fast Movers article was robust, involving individuals who had no prior involvement in the UFO topic but were stunned to see official government briefings on UAP. McMillan added: The information reported in the Fastmovers article, including the description of some images, early assessments, and interest in transmedium UAP, came from multiple sources that had direct access to these early UAPTF intelligence documents. Im sure a lot of people assumed these sources were the usual UFO suspects, e.g. Lue Elizondo, Chris Mellon, etc. However, that couldnt be further from the truth. In fact, Im not even sure Mellon or Elizondo even knew about those intel documents prior to my article. That article had some expert sourcing. However, it all came from people who had no involvement or interest in UAP prior or since. They were primarily willing to talk because it was the first time theyd ever seen anything related to UFOs/UAP being distributed through official channels and they were stunned. Rumors have long circulated on social media since 2020 when the alleged photo was first published by The Debrief. In this example, a completely unrelated photo was misrepresented in order to add legitimacy to their headline. Since the publication of The Debriefs article, the rumored triangular UAP photograph has remained a focal point of discussion within the UFO community. However, Strattons latest comments suggest these claims are based on misinterpretations. When asked why he did not correct the record at the time, Stratton stated, Keep in mind thats an email on an unclassified system. I dont recall if I corrected it on a separate system at the time, but generally, there was no formal process for publicly addressing inaccuracies related to potentially classified reporting. Engaging with speculative reporting was neither standard practice nor always feasible. Other notable documents in the 88 page FOIA release (available below) include extensive media inquiries regarding the roles of AATIP and AAWSAP, with several journalists questioning the involvement of Luis Elizondo and clarifications sought about Navy reporting protocols on UAP sightings. Emails also discuss inquiries into claims related to the Drake Equation and its connection to AATIP, highlighting broader speculation about extraterrestrial life considerations. Correspondence shows ongoing questions about the legitimacy of various reports, DoDs reluctance to engage publicly on speculative stories, and repeated efforts by the media to confirm details about classified briefings and UAP-related photographs. While the newly released documents and Strattons statement seemingly dispel one of the most persistent rumors surrounding UAP evidence in recent years, the broader mystery of unidentified phenomena remains. As official investigations continue and additional information is released, the search for definitive answers continues. Numerous FOIA requests filed by The Black Vault remain open on these issues, and all records released via the FOIA will be published, when available. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/foia-released-emails-mention-alleged-triangular-uap-photo-former-uap-task-force-director-speaks-out/"
"Pentagon Releases AARO Report on Go Fast Video Analysis";"2025-02-10";"The Department of Defenses All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has released a new report analyzing the well-known Go Fast video, which first appeared publicly in 2018. The report, dated February 6, 2025, provides an in-depth assessment of the unidentified object captured in the 2015 video and concludes that the object exhibited no anomalous flight characteristics. The Go Fast video was originally recorded by a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet off the coast of Florida in January 2015. The footage, taken using the jets Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, appeared to show a small, fast-moving object traveling just above the oceans surface. When the Department of Defense officially released the video in 2020, it quickly became one of three widely publicized UAP videos that fueled public and congressional interest in military encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena. According to AAROs report, which is based on a technical analysis of the available footage, the objects actual altitude was approximately 13,000 feet rather than near the oceans surface as originally assumed. The report also estimates the objects speed to be between 5 mph and 92 mph, depending on wind conditions, with AARO asserting that it was moving with the wind and displayed no indications of propulsion or maneuverability inconsistent with atmospheric phenomena.Continue scrolling for more... AARO assesses with high confidence that the object did not move at anomalous speeds, the report states. The objects apparent high speed is attributable to motion parallax, an optical effect that induces an observer to perceive that a stationary or slow-moving object is moving much faster than its actual speed when viewed from a moving frame of reference. Motion parallax is a well-documented phenomenon that can cause misinterpretations of aerial footage, particularly when captured from fast-moving military aircraft. The AARO analysis incorporated historical wind data from the time and location of the encounter, showing that at 13,000 feet, winds were blowing at approximately 69 mph from the west. Their assessment found that the objects speed, when adjusted for wind influence, was within a range consistent with that of a small airborne object such as a balloon or drone. AARO also addressed data limitations in the report, noting that the analysis relied on a compressed version of the video due to the loss of the original file and metadata. Without complete flight telemetry from the F/A-18F, AARO had to account for a range of possible aircraft headings in its calculations. Despite these constraints, the agency maintains confidence in its assessment that the object did not demonstrate any extraordinary flight capabilities. The release of the AARO report has sparked a range of reactions from those who have followed the case. Skeptics of the extraterrestrial hypothesis have pointed to the findings as further evidence that the Go Fast object was likely mundane in origin. Mick West, a well-known investigator of UAP footage, has long argued that the object was most likely a balloon and has stated that AAROs findings align with his own analysis. However, others remain unconvinced. Some researchers argue that the DoDs methodology lacks transparency, particularly given the absence of the original metadata. Former Navy pilot Ryan Graves, who has spoken extensively about encounters with unidentified aerial phenomena, believes broader questions remain about the Navys UAP encounters overall. The conclusions drawn in the recent AARO report align with statements made by Dr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, during his testimony to Congress in November 2024. At that time, Dr. Kosloski explained that the object in the Go Fast video was not as close to the water as it appeared, stating, Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet. He attributed the objects extraordinary appearance to the parallax effect, describing it as a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight. The Go Fast video, along with the Gimbal and FLIR1 (Tic Tac) videos, has played a major role in the increased scrutiny of UAPs over the past decade. The footage first surfaced in 2018 through The New York Times and To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, an organization co-founded by former Blink-182 musician Tom DeLonge. At the time, the release of these videos marked an unprecedented public acknowledgment of military encounters with unidentified objects. Since then, congressional hearings and government reports have continued to fuel debates over the nature and origin of these phenomena. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/pentagon-releases-aaro-report-on-go-fast-video-analysis/"
"The DoD Inspector Generals Evaluation of the DoDs Actions Regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena";"2025-02-06";"This article was originally written in August 2024. However, additional document releases related to these cases have been added, with further context, in the document section below. The article itself will remain unedited, but further context is noted below. In recent years, Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) have received significant attention from both the public and governmental bodies, raising questions about national security and the transparency of investigations into these mysterious sightings. The Department of Defense (DoD), through its Office of Inspector General (OIG), launched Project No. D2021-DEV0SN-0116.000 on May 3, 2021, aimed at evaluating how the DoD has managed reports and investigations related to UAPs. This evaluation became a focal point for many, as it promised to shed light on the DoDs approach to these phenomena. In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by The Black Vault on May 4, 2021, the DoD OIG released 101 pages of internal emails and documents. The original request sought a copy of records (which includes videos/photos), electronic or otherwise, pertaining to Project No. D2021-DEV0SN-0116.000. This would include, but not be limited to, the evaluation objectives, overview, communications about the setup of the project number, etc.Continue scrolling for more... These records, partially redacted, offer a glimpse into that evaluation. Late September 2020: Setting the Stage The first significant exchange occurred in late September 2020, when a DoD OIG official initiated contact with key players in the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security (OUSD(I&S)). The purpose of this outreach was to gather points of contact and arrange briefings on the DoDs efforts related to UAPs. The OIG was particularly interested in the classified annex of the Senate Armed Services Committee Report on the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020, which dealt with Advanced Operational Capabilities Collection, Exploitation, and Research. In one of the early emails, an official wrote, My leadership and I would like to obtain a briefing on the unexplained airborne activities and understand the current efforts and programs in place. Early October 2020: Coordination and Planning By early October, the planning for these briefings began to take shape. On October 1, 2020, Matthew C. Cummings, the Deputy Director for Technical Collection at OUSD(I&S), confirmed his willingness to support the briefing, noting that the Navy typically took the lead on briefing program activities and status. Im happy to fill in any gaps from the OSD level, he added, indicating a collaborative effort across departments. Discussions quickly moved to logistics, with emails exchanged about scheduling and the security clearances required for attendees. An email from October 7, 2020, highlighted the need for participants to have IC blue badges, a requirement reflecting the high level of classified information that would be discussed. We all have our IC blue badges, so we are good to go, said one unidentified individual from the IGs office, ensuring that the necessary security protocols were in place. Mid-October 2020: The Briefing Takes Place As the date of the briefing approached, final preparations were made. The briefing was scheduled for October 15, 2020, in a secure conference room at the Pentagon. The DoD OIG was keen to ensure that the briefing provided the most comprehensive information available, requesting, We would like to receive the briefing at the highest classification available. We want to make sure that we are not limited in the information we receive. The meeting itself, while not detailed in the released emails, likely involved in-depth discussions on the classified aspects of UAP investigations and the DoDs response strategies. Another email of note made reference to a recorded, approximate 25-minute duration, classified UAP briefing created by Stratton. Although this has been discovered before, the length of that video was unknown, until now. Post-Briefing Follow-Up Following the October 15 briefing, the email correspondence reveals continued coordination among the involved parties. The OIG remained engaged, ensuring that any further information or clarification needed for their evaluation would be obtained. This FOIA release marks the first interim disclosure of documents related to Project No. D2021-DEV0SN-0116.000, with more records expected in the future. The process of releasing documents in stages, known as a rolling release, allows for information to be made available to the public as it is processed and reviewed. As additional batches of documents are cleared for release, they will provide further insights into the DoDs actions and internal communications regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, gradually building a more complete picture of the evaluation process. The above should not be considered a complete breakdown, nor the only interesting parts of the release(s) so far sent to The Black Vault. Rather, this is just the start of a timeline, highlighting key parts of the ramp up to the DoD/IG Evaluation.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/the-dod-inspector-generals-evaluation-of-the-dods-actions-regarding-unidentified-aerial-phenomena/"
"AARO Releases Document and Video Explaining Satellite Flares as a UAP Misidentification Source";"2025-01-25";"The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) has released a report titled Correlations of Starlink Satellite Flaring with UAP Observations and an accompanying video explaining the Satellite Flaring Phenomenon. These materials aim to address how optical effects caused by satellites, particularly those in large constellations such as SpaceXs Starlink, can lead to misinterpretations of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP). The report outlines how sunlight reflecting off a satellites surfacessuch as antennas or solar panelscan create bright flashes of light visible from the ground. These reflections are categorized as either diffuse or specular. Diffuse reflection occurs when sunlight scatters off rough surfaces, producing a dimmer but more prolonged glow. Specular reflection, on the other hand, involves light bouncing off smooth, mirror-like surfaces, creating intense but short-lived flares often referred to as glints. Starlink satellites, with their unique design, are particularly prone to creating both types of reflections. The report notes that their solar panels and bus components can generate phenomena that resemble stars moving across the sky or, in some cases, more complex shapes such as triangles or spinning lights. AARO emphasized that the growing number of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO)currently over 6,700 Starlink satellites alonehas significantly increased the frequency of such observations. With thousands more satellites planned for deployment by various companies, including Amazon and Eutelsat, this trend is expected to continue.Continue scrolling for more... The document highlights how these flaring phenomena can account for many UAP sightings, particularly those involving multiple lights or geometric formations. For example, the report examined a 2022 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) UAP report in which an airline pilot described multiple lights moving in different directions near a constellation. AAROs analysis attributed the sighting to Starlink satellite flares. To aid observers, the report provides guidelines for predicting satellite flares, including using online tools to calculate flare visibility based on the Suns position and satellite trajectories. This information is designed to help differentiate satellite-related phenomena from other potential sources of UAP. The analysis also extends to airborne sightings, as pilots often report UAPs that can be linked to satellite flares. Aircraft altitude and speed allow for extended visibility of these phenomena compared to observations from the ground. AARO highlighted that understanding these dynamics is crucial for accurately identifying airborne phenomena.

The animated presentation visually explains how sunlight reflecting off satellites can mimic UAP sightings. According to the accompanying description, the animation demonstrates how sunlight angles and satellite orientation produce optical effects that can be easily misinterpreted as anomalous. AAROs latest releases underscore the importance of distinguishing between man-made optical phenomena and other potential explanations when investigating UAP sightings. By equipping the public and researchers with knowledge and predictive tools, AARO hopes to improve the quality of UAP data and contribute to more accurate assessments of these events. Both the document and video are available on AAROs official website. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/aaro-releases-document-and-video-explaining-satellite-flares-as-a-uap-misidentification-source/"
"FAA Emails Shed Light on UAP Tracking Amid Chinese Balloon Scare";"2025-01-10";"In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed in May 2023 by The Black Vault, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has released 129 pages of documents concerning emails sent to and from Michael Freie, a technical advisor in the FAAs Air Traffic Surveillance Services Office. The request, FOIA case 2024-04951, sought communications containing keywords such as Unidentified Aerial, Unidentified Flying, UAP, UFO, and related terms. The FOIA request stemmed from Mr. Freies involvement as a speaker at NASAs Public UAP Meeting held on May 31, 2023. Known for his expertise in air traffic surveillance, Freie has served as a critical figure within the FAA, providing insights into the systems monitoring U.S. airspace and their limitations. During the meeting, he delivered a detailed explanation of how the FAA monitors civilian airspace and the ongoing challenges in identifying and tracking objects that deviate from typical flight behaviors.Continue scrolling for more... Among the released documents, several emails stand out for their direct relevance to UAP discussions. In an email exchange dated February 13, 2023, Freie referenced radar adjustments made by the Department of Defense (DoD), which could explain increased detections of slow-moving aerial objects. Most tracking filters eliminate plots for targets below 40 or 60 knots airspeed Obviously they adjusted those minimum speed thresholds, he wrote. This adjustment followed the highly publicized detection of Chinese surveillance balloons earlier that year and coincided with a broader governmental focus on aerial object tracking. A U.S. Air Force pilot looked down at the suspected Chinese surveillance balloon as it hovered over the Central Continental United States February 3, 2023. Recovery efforts began shortly after the balloon was downed. (Photo courtesy of the Department of Defense) The Chinese balloon incidents, which began with a reported sighting in late January 2023, triggered a heightened focus on aerial surveillance. Freies emails reveal how the FAA adapted to the situation. He discussed how adjustments to radar tracking thresholds were likely responsible for an uptick in the detection of unidentified objects, noting that these changes allowed for the tracking of slow-moving targets previously filtered out as irrelevant. Additional awareness of these objects is due to adjusted tracking filters, he stated in one email. Other emails illustrate Freies views on interagency collaboration. In one exchange with Amy Gusky, Acting Director of Surveillance Services, Freie emphasized that the Department of Defense should act as the primary spokesperson for national defense issues. He noted, I suggest DoD needs to be the primary spokesperson for National defense because that mission is theirs. A recurring theme in Freies communications was the relationship between budget priorities and technological capabilities. In a February 13, 2023 email, he lamented the defunding of the SENSR (Spectrum Efficient National Surveillance Radar) program, a joint FAA-DoD initiative aimed at modernizing surveillance systems. He remarked that programs like SENSR are needed to recapitalize primary surveillance radar necessary to support national defense programs. The FAA did withhold portions of the records under FOIA Exemptions 3, 5, and 6. Exemption 3 protects information classified under other federal statutes, including critical infrastructure security data. Exemption 5 protects pre-decisional materials to preserve the deliberative process, and Exemption 6 safeguards personal privacy. The release provides a valuable look at how the FAA navigates its responsibilities regarding UAPs and national airspace surveillance. The Chinese balloon incidents serve as a backdrop to the growing challenges faced by the FAA in maintaining effective surveillance and addressing public concerns. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/faa-emails-shed-light-on-uap-tracking-amid-chinese-balloon-scare/"
"Newly Released Documents Reveal Private Meeting Between Canadian MP and UFO Whistleblower";"2025-01-07";"Newly released documents obtained under Canadas Access to Information Act have revealed details of a meeting between Larry Maguire, a Canadian Member of Parliament, and David Grusch, a senior intelligence officer with the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) that many in the media have called The UFO Whistleblower. The meeting, which occurred on May 31, 2022, focused on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) and sheds light on discussions about sensitive topics spanning international borders. The documents, uncovered by open-source researcher Steve Te after a lengthy appeal process, provide partial insight into the exchange but are heavily redacted, leaving significant questions unanswered. The meeting between Maguire and Grusch took place over a year before Gruschs public testimony before the U.S. Congress in July 2023 and prior to his April 2023 Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSR) approval for publicly discussing information related to UAPs. This timing raises important questions about whether Grusch, who discussed highly sensitive topics with a foreign government official, had the necessary authorization or assurances that what he disclosed was unclassified. Despite the unclassified designation of the meeting, the extensive redactions in the documents suggest that the topics discussed were considered sensitive enough to warrant shielding from public view, adding to the controversy surrounding Gruschs role and the international dimensions of UAP discourse. The meeting notes document Maguire asking Grusch 14 detailed questions about UAP-related issues. Gruschs responses touched on topics such as U.S.-Canadian collaboration on UAP investigations, NORADs involvement, and theories about UAP activity near nuclear facilities. Notably, Grusch mentioned the existence of compelling UAP footage held by the U.S. government, which he suggested could help acclimate the public to the reality of the phenomena.Continue scrolling for more... He also referred to historical Canadian research efforts, such as Project Magnet, led by Wilbert Smith in the 1950s, indicating a potential historical role for Canada in gathering and studying UAP data. Badge of the Royal Canadian Air Force In discussing current U.S.-Canadian interactions, Grusch described limited cooperation between the two nations, citing classified meetings between the U.S. National Intelligence Manager for Aviation and the Royal Canadian Air Force earlier that year. He also emphasized the necessity of physical evidence to determine the origins of UAP, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on passive data collection such as radar and infrared sensors. Yet, many of his statements were obscured by redactions, which included entire answers to several key questions posed by Maguire. The redactions themselves raise critical questions about the transparency of the meeting and the information exchanged. Canadian authorities justified the redactions by citing potential harm to international relations, specifically with the United States. Despite these justifications, it remains unclear why a meeting believed to be unclassified would require such extensive redactions. Since June 2023, The Black Vault has been pursuing a FOIA request with the NGA to obtain emails from David Gruschs inbox containing a comprehensive list of UAP-related keywords. This request holds the potential to unveil an extraordinary inside look at Gruschs UAP-related activities, including his meeting with Maguire and possibly much more. However, as of the day this article is published, The Black Vault has been informed by the NGA that the request is approximately #200 on the agencys backlog list, with an estimated completion time stretching to 22 to 25 months.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/newly-released-documents-reveal-private-meeting-between-canadian-mp-and-ufo-whistleblower/"

It is an evolving article, and is updated to archive additional information released. Last update was on December 18, 2024. Above Video Recorded June 2021Continue scrolling for more... On February 23, 2021, The Drives WarZone broke a story about a UFO encounter on February 21, which involved American Airlines Flight 2292 and an encounter with a cylindrical-shaped object moving at a high speed. According to articles written by Tyler Rogoway: American Airlines Flight 2292, an Airbus A320 flying between Cincinnati and Phoenix on February 21st, 2021, had a bizarre close encounter with what its crew described as a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile moving extremely fast over the top of their aircraft as it cruised along at 36,000 feet and 400 knots. The incident occurred over the remote northeast corner of New Mexico, to the west of the tiny town of Des Moines. Then he published: Less than 48 hours after our initial reporting on an outright strange incident involving American Airlines Flight 2292 as it flew at 36,000 feet over the northeastern corner of New Mexico on February 21st, 2021, we have confirmation that the event in question did indeed occur and that it is being investigated by the FBI. The incident involved pilots of the Airbus A320 being buzzed by an unidentified cylindrical-shaped object moving at high-speed, which resulted in them querying the FAAs Albuquerque Air Route Traffic Control Center. The Black Vault filed numerous FOIA requests, including ones to the FBI and to the FAA, based on the above reporting. The FAA Records In this case, as responded to on June 21, the FAA refused to confirm or deny whether records exist on the event.

"Transcript: Dr. Jon Kosloski, Director, AARO, Media Roundtable on the FY24 Consolidated Annual Report on UAP  November 14, 2024";"2024-11-18";"STAFF: For those who havent met me, I am Sue Gough from the Defense Press Operations in the OSD  Office of the Secretary Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. We are here today to hear what Doctor Jon Kosloski, the new director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, has to say about AAROs activities and the release today of the unclassified version of their annual report on unidentified anomalous phenomena, as required by  by statute. Im going to  in a moment, Ill turn it over to Dr. Kosloski to provide opening remarks, then we will go to Q&A. I will be moderating and calling on you. Because Dr. Kosloski is  this is his first time with you all, we would appreciate it if you would identify yourself by name and outlet when you ask your question. Please keep it to one question and one follow up. And as we  if we have more time, I will circle back. We have about 30 minutes. All right, Dr. Kosloski. DR. JON KOSLOSKI: Thanks, Sue. Good morning. Im Dr. Jon Kosloski, director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office or AARO. Its a pleasure to be here today to introduce myself and to provide an update of the work of our office. As you know, I assumed the AARO directorship in August following more than two decades at the National Security Agency where I did advanced research in the areas of optics, computing and crypto mathematics.Continue scrolling for more... By nature, Im drawn to tough scientific problems, which is what brought me to AARO and the UAP mission. Unidentified objects in any domain pose potential threats to safety and security. Reports of unidentified anomalous phenomenon, particularly near national security sites, must be treated seriously and investigated with scientific rigor by the U.S. government. Since becoming director, Ive been extremely pleased by AAROs team and the framework theyve established for rigorous analysis of UAP reports. AARO has taken meaningful steps to improve data collection and retention, bolster sensor development, effectively triage UAP reports, and reduce the stigma of reporting a UAP event. In the coming year, AARO will prioritize building partnerships, promoting increased transparency and scaling up the work of the office. This week, the department delivered its Fiscal Year 2024 consolidated annual report on UAP and had the opportunity to brief congressional staff on the reports findings. As of today, over 1,600 UAP reports, 757 of which  Im sorry, AARO has received over 1,600 UAP reports, over 757 of which came to AARO during the period covered by the report. AARO has successfully resolved hundreds of cases in its holdings to commonplace objects such as balloons, birds, drones, satellites and aircraft. Meanwhile, over 900 reports lack sufficient data for  scientific data for analysis and are retained in our active archive. These cases may be reopened and resolved, should additional information emerge to support analysis. I want to emphasize that although only a very small percentage of reports to AARO are potentially anomalous, these are the cases that require significant time, resources and a focused scientific inquiry by AARO and its partners. It is also important to underscore that to date, AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology. None of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies. It is also worth noting that AARO continues to see a geographic bias of UAP reports near U.S. military assets and sensors. However, this bias has been mitigated somewhat by an increase in commercial pilot reporting in the continental United States. AARO is working closely with the services to implement existing reporting guidance while expanding UAP reporting to more of the interagency. Meanwhile, AARO continues to review the U.S. historical record relating to UAP and will release a second volume of its congressionally directed Historical Record Report. We welcome any former or current government civilian, contractor or military service member with relevant information to reach out to us at www.AARO.mil. For every UAP report, operational or historical, AARO will follow the science and data wherever they lead. And we are committed to sharing as much information as possible at the unclassified level to inform the public of our activities and findings. With that, Ill take your questions. STAFF: Brandi? Q: Thanks. Thank you so much for doing this. Im Brandi Vincent with Defense Scoop. One question on the report and then a follow-up. It noted that the next step for Gremlin, the Gremlin capability, is conducting a 90-day pattern of life collection at a national security site. Where is that going to be? How did you pick that location? And what ultimately are you guys trying to accomplish with that? DR. KOSLOSKI: So its currently deployed. Wed rather not say exactly where it is because we want it to be an unbiased test and dont want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system. We chose that specific location because of the environment. We expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that were going to see. And there had been UAP reports in that general area. And were trying to build a baseline. So, right now, we have this geographic bias where we are getting reports near the national security sites. But we also have a bias from pilots and other security personnel. So we want to have a better understanding of what normal looks like near those national security sites. And then eventually well be expanding our baseline investigations to other areas in the U.S. to look at what normal looks like away from national security sites. Q: And then, after the hearing on the Hill yesterday, lawmakers were saying that they are really keen to meet in a SCIF with AARO officials, other DOD officials, whistleblowers and members of Congress. Is that something youve been approached about, have done or are open to doing? DR. KOSLOSKI: So were absolutely open to meeting with everybody. Weve been meeting with a variety of folks, from whistleblowers through staffers. And we encourage anybody with direct information to come to us, go to our secure reporting mechanism on the website. And when we get that, well reach out to them, schedule a meeting in the SCIF. And Congress has enabled us to receive all sensitive information regardless of classification or NDAs they may have signed. And we receive that information. And we follow-up on every tip that they provide us. Q: Thank you. DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. STAFF: Oren Q: Two questions. One, I was wondering if you could talk about whether any analysis or data of reports you have received has led you to the foreign adversary conclusion, specifically the UASs  18 reports of UASs spotted near nuclear facilities? And then I was wondering if you could just talk about the  the  the effort to increase engagement with foreign partners for a better a broader array of sensors, data analysis information. DR. KOSLOSKI: Sure. So, firstly, no, we have not been able to correlate any UAP activity to adversarial collection activities or advanced technologies. I also want to make it clear that UAP covers a lot of potential activity by its very nature. The definition is in the name, right? So its unidentified and its anomalous. Once we know that its a UAV or a UAS of some nature, we then hand that responsibility off to one of our partners. So Langley being a great example. It was known to be UAV activity, so we were there in a supporting role, but it was not our responsibility to address that. So those investigations are conducted by somebody else. And were focusing on the truly anomalous where we dont understand the activity. And then for the foreign engagement, were working on increasing our foreign engagement. We recognize that UAP is not just going to be a domestic issue. The office has focused primarily on U.S. government. And were going to be growing to public reporting soon in 2025. And were going to be growing our international partnerships hopefully also in 2025. So starting with the group that we have the most familiar  familiarity with and then growing that from there. Q: Are there any specific countries you can name in terms of who you aim to work with? DR. KOSLOSKI: We are going to be starting with the traditional allies of the DOD and the IC. And Ill leave it at that for now until we have those partnerships well established and then well probably come out with more information. Yes. STAFF: Yes. Nick? Q: Nick Schifrin, PBS NewsHour. Thanks very much for doing this. This may be basic and silly, but I just want to read you a quotation from the hearing yesterday and have you respond to it. This is Luis Elizondo, former DOD official. Let me be clear. UAP are real. Advanced technologies not made by our government or any other government are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe. The U.S. is in possession of UAP technologies as are some of our adversaries. Can you just give us a sense of your perspective on that quotation? DR. KOSLOSKI: Break that down, so theres a lot in that quotation. Firstly, absolutely agree. UAP are real. We  as I said, weve received 1,600 cases. A large number of those are unresolved, which means we dont know exactly what they are. Until we know what they are or who they belong to, we cant attribute intent and understand exactly what the purpose of that phenomenon is. So were not comfortable we at AARO, are not comfortable saying at this time whether or not the UAP are there to collect information or not. In regards to whether or not AARO, U.S. government or any other government has UAP. We have not found any evidence of that at this time. Q: but the bottom line conclusion remains what you said at the top  There is no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial activity. DR. KOSLOSKI: We have not found any, no. There are definitely anomalies. We have not been able to draw the link to extraterrestrial. STAFF: Phil. Q: Just to follow up on that. DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. Q: You know, a lot of people read that or saw  just that hearing. You know, when you said there was no breakthrough technologies. I mean the person seems to be suggesting that, you know, at a minimum these are breakthrough technologies. What leads you to assume that the ones that the UAP cases that you cant resolve are not potentially breakthrough technologies? Or is it that you just havent been able to conclusively decide either way? DR. KOSLOSKI: Thats exactly right. So we dont fully understand the phenomenon enough to say whether or not its a breakthrough technology or not. So its a very small percentage of our overall cases that after the initial analysis still have the anomalous characteristics that one could attribute breakthrough technologies to. Its less than 3.5% of our cases. And were still studying those with our IC and S&T partners, trying to understand what technologies could be used to provide those characteristics. But we dont understand them well enough to say whether its a breakthrough technology, a misunderstanding of the sensor performance or something else. Q: And a skeptic might say that, you know, if you  just because you cant explain it isnt a reason to assume that its not a breakthrough technology or I mean by the definition of breakthrough technology would be something that you dont have  if you dont have it, you cant explain, right? DR. KOSLOSKI: Agree 100%. So, were not ruling it out. Were open to that as an explanation for it. But were just not attributing breakthrough technology as the explanation to it. Were  an open mind works both ways. So if we dont understand what it is, we cant say that it is or is not a breakthrough technology. So were just trying to keep an open mind. Q: Got it. Its not a catch 22. DR. KOSLOSKI: Right. Q: (inaudible) OK. DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. It  we accept that the explanation could be a misunderstanding of ours in interpreting the data or it could be a breakthrough technology. Until we understand, we dont know. Q: Thank you. Brad Dress, for The Hill. Have you found anything that might be a breakthrough technology? I know youre saying you dont know if there are breakthroughs yet, but something that might be a breakthrough technology near the military sites, some of those sightings youve seen near the military sites, have you found anything that might be that? Or are they all just been drones and UAS? DR. KOSLOSKI: Its definitely not all just drones and UAS. So we have several particularly interesting cases. Were working on within the office, working with our partners to downgrade several of those cases, so we can talk about them publicly. But there are interesting cases that I, with my physics and engineering background and time in the IC, I do not understand. And I dont know anybody else who understands them either. Q: But those near military sites and facilities? DR. KOSLOSKI: Until we get the information approved for release, Id rather not say where those sightings were, but definitely interesting sightings. Q: OK. Thank you. Tanya Nori with NewsNation. Can you please speak to AAROs involvement in investigating incidents of drone or UAP, UAV incursions at the U.S. southern border with Mexico? DR. KOSLOSKI: So we  Im not that familiar with any specific investigations that we have  that AARO has supported for UAP or sorry, UAS, UAV activity near the southern border. We have had several UAP cases that have been brought to us that were near the border that weve investigated. I believe that we have resolved the cases that have been brought to us. And were working on downgrading those so that we can share those. Q: And do you  can you speak to the procedures that are in place for Border Patrol agents to report UFO sightings? And how are those reports handled and investigated by the Pentagon overall and by AARO specifically? DR. KOSLOSKI: So at this time, I dont believe we have a formal mechanism for Border Patrol to report to AARO. Right now, the only formal mechanism is through the DOD. And were working on expanding that across the government through the interagency and for public reporting. We expect that formally to be in place hopefully in 2025. Right now, were getting those cases more through partnerships that those folks have with DOD or counterintelligence members. STAFF: Luis? Q: Hi. Luis Martinez with ABC News. Thank you for doing this and welcome. DR. KOSLOSKI: Thank you for coming. Q: Yes. I would like to follow-up on that earlier question about incidents you cannot explain based on your, you know, broad experience. A couple of follow-ups on that, please. Were these all within the last year? Were these all at the same location? Were you looking at video evidence? Or what are the metrics that youre looking at that you cannot explain? DR. KOSLOSKI: Great question. So of the cases that Im thinking of, theres a variety of them. The cases that are top of my mind are spread out over the last year and a half. Im sure that theres some other anomalous ones a little further back. But the ones that Im particularly most interested in are the last year and a half. There is some video footage for a few of the cases, not all of the cases. So its not just eyewitnesses. But in each of the cases Im particularly interested in, there were multiple eyewitnesses. And there is additional data to go with them. It remains to be seen whether or not that additional data is going to be sufficient for us to either resolve the case, understand whether its a UAV, bird or balloon, or say something substantive about the nature of the unknown phenomenon. So were still trying to understand whether or not theres more data available. Because we get the data that comes in from the witnesses. But we also go through a bunch of other sources. Whether or not we can enrich the data that was brought to us and then build a better case. Still digging into it. Q: What are some of the characteristics or are there  is there a trend among these things? And are they extended period incidents or are they very, very quick? DR. KOSLOSKI: In each of these cases, they were not extended. The cases that Im thinking of, there was no commonality across the different cases, different morphologies, so orbs, cylinders, triangles. In one of the cases, it has been happening over an extended period of time. And it is possible that theres multiple things happening. There could be some UAV activity in the environment thats getting confused or conflated with the UAP activity, so were trying to tease that out right now. Q: Just to clarify, earlier, you said Langley was UAVs. This  who  the Langley incidents would not be among what youre describing? DR. KOSLOSKI: Correct. Q: OK. DR. KOSLOSKI: Correct. STAFF: Konstantin? Q: Thanks. Konstantin Toropin with Military.com. So one of the sort of key criticisms, I think, around this issue from the hearing yesterday was government transparency, lack of government transparency. I mean, can you sort of speak to that critique and whether you feel that AARO is being overly secretive? If you guys are working on being more transparent, sort of address this criticism from the Hill that you guys are emblematic of a government that overtly classifies everything and? DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes, yes, its an understandable concern. And Im going to make a comment. My wife would like me to share more about the UAP incidents too, but Ill  I guess its on the record now, so. (Laughter) The fundamental issue is that AARO receives cases from our partners. And in most cases, to date, because weve been working through the services, those partners are providing data that is gathered from sensitive platforms. And we need to make sure that we are protecting sensitive sources and methods not introducing vulnerabilities to their operations. So even though that theres nothing inherently classified about the existence of a UAP, we have to protect that information. When AARO receives those interesting cases, the cases that were just briefly talking about, we try to identify if the UAP information can be isolated from the sensitive  usually its metadata that identifies characteristics of the platform. And we work to downgrade that material as much as we can. But we cant do it unilaterally. It has to be in partnership with the folks that brought that information. That is a very deliberate process, as you can imagine, to make sure that were not releasing sensitive information. So we have taken significant steps to speed that up. Weve hired a number of declassification experts. Were going to be hosting a declassification workshop, so we can make sure were implementing best practices from across the DOD and the IC. All of that takes more time than I think the public would like for it to take, but AARO is working on it. We recognize that the types of cases that I was just talking about are, from my perspective, true anomalies. And were going to need significant scientific rigor to address those. And yes, the U.S. government has a lot of nice scientists, little bias there, but were going to need the help of academia and the public to address some of these so we need to build that more transparent partnership. Q: And just to follow-up sort of on the flip side, you know, is there any  as you look at cases to release for example, you talked about how at least one of the interesting ones is sort of ongoing. Is there a world where you hold back release out of fear of drawing more reports, you know, sort of drawing attention to a location and getting copycats or you know what have you sort of muddying the data? DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes, so that concern has been raised to us. Because bad data in gets bad analysis out. However, no data in gets no analysis out. And so, being an NSA guy, Im a firm believer in big data is going to lead to better conclusions. And I would rather have to filter out some of those copycat cases but have more substantive data. If were looking for a needle in a haystack, Id rather have multiple haystacks to go digging through rather than just one. Q: Thank you. STAFF: Brandi. Q: Just one quick follow up. DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. Q: Im sorry if Ive missed it before, but what is AARO or your definition for breakthrough technology? DR. KOSLOSKI: So lots of people, lots of organizations have different definitions. And the definition, the working definition that weve been using informally inside of our office, and we are working on more formal definitions for the different domains for space, the air domain and the undersea domain. But the general definition is beyond state of the art today and beyond where we think that we could get in the next couple years. So we keep an eye on the capabilities of ourselves, our partners and everyone else at the academic and the very technical level. And then if its beyond that, then we would say thats a breakthrough technology. STAFF: Phil. Q: Just a quick follow-up on your answer to Konstantin. DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. Q: So, if you need to  I mean, I guess a lot of Americans have this view of the government as kind of all-knowing and being able to ascertain, you know, everything, particularly when they think of NSA and other agencies. DR. KOSLOSKI: If only. Q: And so, I guess if you could help us explain to readers, you know, what is it about these phenomena that  that, you know, reach the limits of government of the understanding of the professionals in the government and why it would be necessary to bring in academics? Thatd be helpful for us. DR. KOSLOSKI: Great question. So following on Brandis question, if its a breakthrough technology by its very nature, we dont know how it would be done, right? If we knew how to do it, wed be doing it already and it wouldnt be a breakthrough technology. And so, usually those breakthroughs are coming from the academics. Historically, either in science or engineering, the breakthroughs come from academia and then they go into industry and then they come into government. The governments employing a lot of scientists like myself and others who understand a fair amount about the science. But being able to extend that to something that we could not have imagined when we were in school or when we were in training is a very difficult process. And so were going to have to pull in those folks that they spend all day every day just thinking of what is the next possible thing that you could do if you were just to tweak the equations a little bit this way or change the material a little bit that way. And the government, because of our day jobs we dont get to spend all day every day doing that as much as I would like to. STAFF: Nick? Q: Just two small clarification, so the  what you called interesting cases at the beginning and then Luis asked you more specific spread out over the last year and a half. Just to be clear, those are cases that we dont know about, right? Meaning, we have not read about these cases that youre speaking about? DR. KOSLOSKI: Correct, correct. Q: You said to Luis, one of the cases has been happening over extended period of time. I think Konstantin said ongoing. Just to be clear, that is ongoing or you just or was it just happening over extended period of time? And youre not saying whether its extended or not? DR. KOSLOSKI: Extended period of time. It may be ongoing. But we dont know if the current activity is just drone activity in the environment. And so, were trying to follow-up on that. We had put more energy into it earlier on, something flared up and now were checking on it. Q: OK. Q: Ellie, CBS. Just a follow-up on the interesting cases. Are the interesting cases that youre talking about the 21 cases that merit further analysis or are they part of the active archive? DR. KOSLOSKI: Theyre part of the 21, yes, that merit. So the active archive, just so that were clear, those are cases where we dont have enough scientific data to continue the analysis. Were always looking for more. And then when we do, well pull those into the merit more analysis. Yes. STAFF: Luis Q: Last years report in the time frame had 281 new, I believe incidents. Now you have 485. What do we owe this really large increase to? DR. KOSLOSKI: So I just the new incidents I think to be clear, this  it had 757. Q: In your report here, you talk about a total of 757, you know, in the period of the reporting period. DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. Q: Of which 485 were from this year and then the remainder were from previous. DR. KOSLOSKI: Oh, yes. Yes. Q: But then, in last years report, which was from  and Im looking at my notes here  DR. KOSLOSKI: Why the ramp up in reporting? Q: Yes, I mean an additional 200, I mean in the same reporting period? DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. Engagement. Q: Right. DR. KOSLOSKI: So were  we have the GENADMIN out. Were engaged with the services. Were engaging more with the services, helping them understand what qualifies as a UAP, how to report it. And were getting more reports of the anomalous activity. Its not that theres we dont believe that theres necessarily more anomalous activity. Its just, were getting greater, greater reporting. And we expect as we continue that engagement with the services, but also across the IC and the rest of the government to the question earlier, were going to see that reporting go up as well. Were going to follow that with education campaigns, so that for example, the FAA is providing us reports now as well. So were getting reports from the pilots. Some of the reports from the pilots are Starlink flares, so light glinting off of satellites at just the right time of the evening. It looks interesting and potentially anomalous. But we can model that and we can show pilots what that anomaly looks like, so that that doesnt get reported to us necessarily. So were going to follow up the engagement campaigns with education campaigns so that as were increasing the number of accounts that come to us, were not just getting more of the noise and trying to keep it focused on the interesting. STAFF: Oren. Q: Just a very quick question on the active archive, do you have an instance or instances where you have gotten more information for an event in the active archive and have pulled it out or is that? DR. KOSLOSKI: Thank you for asking. We do, yes. (Laughter) Yes, we do. So it actually was the instance that Im most familiar with was a Starlink instance. So we had several folks over the period, I think, it was multiple months, where were seeing interesting activity in the sky. And we found that when we  because were continuously looking back at that active archive and looking for correlations across those incidents, but also new incidents coming in. We found some of those correlations in time, the direction that they were looking, and the location. And we were able to assess that they were all in those cases looking at Starlink flares. Yes. STAFF: (inaudible) Q: How many people work in your office? DR. KOSLOSKI: We have several dozen folks working in the office, but the power of the office isnt the number of people who work in it, its our partnerships across the IC and the DOD. And hopefully, in the near future academia as well. STAFF: Luis. Q: In the historical report from earlier this year, there was mentioned that in the 1950s and 60s as pilots started, commercial pilots started flying, they saw reflections as well off of what were like U-2 aircraft at that time. So this new Starlink seems to be very reminiscent of that. Thats DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes, very reminiscent. Yes. Q: So youre seeing an uptick in that, that might be again, a historical parallel, right? DR. KOSLOSKI: Yes. And we do see some trends in the morphologies that are reported. So for a while, we were seeing a lot more balloons. And then pilots started understanding what some of the space trash looked like. And now were seeing as the mega satellite constellations are increasing, Starlink and theres others that are going up, were seeing an increase in those lights in the sky that look very unusual as those satellites are deploying. And we expect that that trend will also go down eventually. Yes. STAFF: Ellie? Q: I have to ask a broadcast specific question, but do you anticipate releasing any video related to any of the cases that were ruled out or that are still unexplained? DR. KOSLOSKI: So were going to be  we have some resolved cases that are of public interest that have been talked about publicly that will be releasing on the 19th. I think those are going to come with videos? Yes. And then, as we downgrade information, the hope is that we will be able to release as much of that content as we can to the public so that we can get help in resolving them. Yes. STAFF: Mosheh? Q: Thanks for doing this. Mosheh Gaines with NBC. You said earlier that there wasnt evidence that the UAP activity was linked to foreign adversaries. But Im wondering, have you seen any kind of suggestion that foreign adversaries have been trying to capitalize off of this with disinformation or anything else? DR. KOSLOSKI: We have not. But I am concerned that somebody could use the potential stigma to and take advantage of that. If there is a stigma associated with reporting UAP, then thats an opportunity for the adversary to maybe conduct collection operations and not have folks report on it. But we havent seen evidence of that yet. STAFF: Weve got time for one more question. Anybody have one? (inaudible) Q: So can you speak to any historic incidents like the Phoenix Lights incident in the 1990s, which many who claimed to have been a witness to the event feel the government has never taken seriously? DR. KOSLOSKI: So, we take those incidents very seriously. And were going to be releasing some analysis in the upcoming Volume II Historical Report in the next few months, where we were able to resolve a number of historic cases. There are quite a few cases of public interest where we have resource limitations, either we cant get enough technical data from  back. In the case of the Phoenix, theres lots of video. And we can  were still working on that. I was actually having a conversation with somebody earlier this morning about additional data we can get for the Phoenix case. But in a lot of the historic cases, were going looking for film. And the film has been recycled or destroyed because its too expensive to retain. And so were going to museums. And all of that takes a lot of manpower. At the same time, were trying to resolve these other interesting cases that are coming in continuously, these 1,600 cases that we have. So were trying to balance those. But the historical report thats coming out will have some of those that you had asked about. STAFF: All right, folks. Thank you very much. DR. KOSLOSKI: Thank you very much. Q: Thank you.

"DoD Releases 2024 UAP Annual Report: 757 New Sightings Recorded Amid Growing National Security Concerns";"2024-11-14";"The Department of Defense (DoD), alongside the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), delivered its 2024 Annual Report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) to Congress this week, fulfilling requirements outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022, with amendments from the FY 2023 NDAA. The report, produced by the DoDs All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), presents a comprehensive update on UAP sightings and analyses, covering incidents reported from May 2023 through June 2024. According to the report, AARO received a total of 757 UAP reports during this period. Out of these, 485 incidents occurred within the last year, while the remaining 272 involved sightings from 2021 and 2022 that had not been previously cataloged. These new additions bring the total number of UAP cases reviewed by AARO to over 1,600 as of June 1, 2024. The DoD emphasizes that UAP reports are critical to national security. Every incursion into designated air, sea, or space zones is taken seriously, with each sighting undergoing a systematic, data-driven analysis. AAROs mandate includes examining these sightings for potential threats to service members, U.S. facilities, and sensitive operations.Continue scrolling for more...

"Navy Blocks Release of UAP Photos Amid Capitol Hill Hearing on Government Secrecy";"2024-11-14";"The U.S. Navy has formally denied access to 78 documents containing photos marked as unidentified aerial [anomalous] phenomena (UAP). The denial, issued yesterday in response to a FOIA request filed by The Black Vault in 2022 and given case number DON-NAVY-2022-012661, highlights the Navys continued use of national defense and intelligence exemptions to keep UAP data classified. The response arrived less than an hour before a highly anticipated UAP hearing on Capitol Hill, where members of Congress heard testimony about the governments lack of transparency on the issue. Journalist Michael Shellenberger holds up redacted UAP Task Force briefing documents, first obtained by The Black Vault The hearing, titled Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth, was led yesterday by Chairwoman Nancy Mace and Congressman Glenn Grothman, heads of various Congressional subcommittees on cybersecurity, government innovation, and national security. This marked the second time Congress has convened specifically on UAP matters, with the hearing aimed at addressing the classified veil surrounding government-held UAP data. The witness panel included Navy Rear Admiral Dr. Tim Gallaudet, former Department of Defense official Luis Elizondo, NASA Associate Administrator Michael Gold, and journalist Michael Shellenberger. Each expressed concerns about the DoDs ongoing reluctance to disclose UAP information. The Navys response to the FOIA request, ironically timed alongside the Capitol Hill session, raises significant questions about the scope and depth of information kept from public scrutiny.Continue scrolling for more... According to the response letter, 78 documents were located following a search conducted by the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare (OPNAV N2/N6). After the completion of the search, reads the letter, it was determined that these documents are exempt in their entirety from disclosure under FOIA 5 U.S.C.  552, specifically under Exemption (b)(1) and in accordance with the UAP Security Classification Guide #04-030. Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) Security Classification Guide, ID#04-030, Naval Intelligence Activity The use of Exemption (b)(1) and the UAP Classification Guide signals the Navys position that these photos, or photo-bearing documents, represent materials that could impact national defense or foreign policy if disclosed. Exemption (b)(1) covers information properly and currently classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, as specified by Executive Order 13526, which protects military operations, intelligence methods, and national security infrastructure. According to the Navy, the 78 denied documents align with Executive Order criteria such as (a) operations and military plans, weapons systems, and operations set forth by the command (c) intelligence activities, intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology and (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services related to national security. As such, none of the responsive records are being released, and the public, along with the media, will remain in the dark on the true nature and specifics of this imagery. The Black Vaults recent request for Navy-held UAP photographs stemmed from a small array of previous FOIA requests, which began in April 2020. Those requests, filed to different offices in the Navy, sought videos of UAP incidents. The case ultimately wound up at the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (N2/N6), and in 2022, they issued a complete denial declaring that all requested UAP videos were classified and therefore exempt from release. This disclosure represented a landmark confirmation at the time: the U.S. Navy not only holds an untold number of unreleased UAP videos (the Navy would not confirm how many) but acknowledges that the material is so sensitive it must be shielded entirely from public view. The secrecy surrounding the UAP issue has strengthened ever since, and this newest denial is yet another testament to that reality. The current FOIA request, filed in September 2022, expanded on that string of FOIA cases, to specifically cover UAP-related photographs. The Navys latest response suggests that UAP photos, like their video counterparts, remain tightly controlled to this day. The UAP Security Classification Guide, also cited in the denial, was first obtained in redacted form by The Black Vault in December 2021. It serves as the Department of Defenses blueprint for classifying UAP information, and has since April 2020 when it was first signed by former Director of Naval Intelligence Activity (NIA) Scott Bray. The UAP Security Classification Guide (SCG) is heavily redacted, fully shielding from the public view how, and what, they classify about UAP As described in the guide, these data categories are intended to limit access to information that could expose military vulnerabilities or reveal intelligence sources and methods. The guide has been a central component in the Navys consistent denials under FOIA, effectively preventing any direct visual evidence from reaching the public. With the denial of the, at least, 78 photos, the guide remains at the heart of ongoing transparency concernsa fact underlined during yesterdays UAP hearing itself, where the witnesses repeatedly pointed to excessive classification as a barrier to public understanding. The withheld photos, whether representing simple stills or part of broader compilations like presentations, constitute a minimum of 78 visuals. However, each document could theoretically contain multiple images, possibly escalating the volume of UAP evidence the Navy possesses but withholds. This releaseor lack thereofhighlights the tension between government agencies and a growing demand for openness from Congress, the media, and the American public. For those invested in transparency, this denial underscores a critical issue: as long as the Navy adheres to national security exemptions in FOIA cases, and cites the UAP Classification Guide in justifying these refusals, a complete understanding of the UAP phenomena will remain hidden. The timing of this denial reinforces that, despite Congressional efforts to expose the truth, the Navys commitment to secrecy around UAP data is far from waning. An appeal has been filed by The Black Vault. ### FOIA Response Letter Follow The Black Vault on Social Media:";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/navy-blocks-release-of-uap-photos-amid-capitol-hill-hearing-on-government-secrecy/"

"U.S. Navy Releases UAP Briefing Documents";"2024-11-05";"One example of a FOIA Appeal win granting (in part) that the Navy FOIA office revisit and expedite The Black Vaults request for the March 11, 2020, UAP briefing. Other cases also had similar filings and results. The U.S. Navy has recently released several Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) briefing documents through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), shedding new light on the U.S. governments involvement investigating the phenomenon through the now disbanded UAP Task Force (UAPTF). Some of these briefings were tied to FOIA cases and subsequent appeals filed by The Black Vault, fighting for the release of these records that were originally denied in full or stonewalled due to excessive processing times that went on for years, despite expedited processing being granted after the initial filing. These briefings, created through the 2020/2021 timeframe by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the UAPTF, were prepared for high-level defense committees and officials, including the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), U.S. Marine Corps, and the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence (DDNI) and others. While the documents remain heavily redacted to protect national security, they reveal significant details about UAPs and how U.S. agencies view these unexplained aerial phenomena as potential threats. The documents all have substantial redactions under exemption (b)(1), which conceals information critical to national security. Even the classification level itself is withheld, emphasizing the sensitivity of the briefings. The UAPTF, operating under ONI, led an interagency effort to collect, analyze, and share operational, scientific, and technical data on UAPs in a bid to understand their implications for aviation safety and U.S. national security. The focus on safety and security is evident, as multiple sections in the briefings underscore the frequency of UAP encounters near military training areas and sensitive airspace, where what they also refer to as Range Foulers interfere with air operations.Continue scrolling for more... U.S. aircrews have described close and often unsettling encounters with these objects, which often display advanced, non-traditional flight characteristics and appear through multi-sensor detections, including radar and infrared. The UAPTFs task, as detailed in the May 17, 2021, briefing, is to gather and centralize such data while removing stigma from reporting incidents, encouraging more aircrews to report sightings without fear of professional reprisal. According to these documents, the task force views these reports as critical for anticipating and addressing potential foreign technology and intelligence threats. Throughout the briefings, several examples of UAP encounters are shared, though most remain heavily redacted. One example describes a UAP observed as a spherical object that moved toward the waters surface before disappearing, with search efforts for wreckage yielding no results. Another incident notes the sighting of triangular objects through visual confirmation and sensors, which, like many other sightings, originated near U.S. training areas where both routine and intensive testing occurs. These briefings reveal that the UAPTF was actively working with partners across the Department of Defense, as well as with agencies like NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the intelligence community, to expand its data analysis capabilities. While a specific classification level was redacted, documents also reveal that a framework is in place to use these reports to cue various other advanced means of tracking and analysis across multiple agencies. This coordinated data-sharing approach points to the high priority given to understanding and mitigating the risks associated with UAP encounters. Each document emphasizes the need to develop a comprehensive approach for analyzing UAP incidents, with experts across science, intelligence, and technology sectors contributing to the process. The UAPTF is tasked with preparing periodic assessments for Congress, with efforts directed toward enhancing data collection, analysis, and the establishment of more streamlined reporting standards.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/u-s-navy-releases-uap-briefing-documents/"
"Army and To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science: Unveiling the Secrecy Behind the UFO Material Testing Agreement";"2024-10-24";"In October 2019, the U.S. Army and To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science (TTSA) (now To The Stars Media) entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), sparking public interest due to TTSAs high-profile focus on UFO research and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP). The agreement allowed the Army access to alleged exotic materials in exchange for providing TTSA with research facilities and expertise. As the agreements existence became known, many hoped it would offer concrete evidence about UAP-related materials. Yet, over time, it became clear that the level of secrecy surrounding this partnership would keep much of the public in the dark. The story first appeared on The Black Vault in the article Secrecy Deepens About U.S. Army Agreement to Analyze UFO Material published on October 17, 2019. In it, The Black Vault outlined the initial revelations and the air of mystery surrounding the agreement. Despite TTSAs press release announcing the CRADA, few details were available about the material involved or the specific goals of the research. This secrecy raised concerns that the public might never fully understand the scope of the collaboration. The article highlighted that the Army, despite being relatively open about some aspects of the agreement, did not disclose the nature or origin of the material it intended to study. Months later, The Black Vault followed up with a second article titled Army Confirms Testing UFO Debris Secrecy May Loom for Years About Results, published on March 4, 2020. This marked a significant milestone in public awareness, as the Army officially confirmed it was actively conducting tests on materials linked to UAPs, which it had obtained through TTSA. The article also highlighted growing public frustration as little information was being shared about the testing process or the findings.Continue scrolling for more... The Black Vaults investigation into the Army-TTSA collaboration took another turn when the Department of Defense Exempts Records on To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science article was published on January 25, 2021. This third installment revealed that the Department of Defense (DoD) invoked specific exemptions to block the release of CRADA-related documents through FOIA requests. These exemptions, notably those regarding national defense and foreign policy, cast doubt on whether the public would ever have full access to the results or documentation related to the tests conducted under the CRADA. Together, these three articles document the evolving but highly restricted public knowledge of the Army-TTSA agreement. The agreement initially sparked hope that the Armys involvement would bring scientific scrutiny and transparency to the investigation of UAP materials. However, over time, it became apparent that the Armys testing would remain largely shielded from public view, with secrecy surrounding the results and the materials involved growing deeper. The Black Vault, through numerous FOIA requests, has continued to press for the release of material generated by the CRADA. This dedicated archive serves as a repository for all related documentation, reflecting the ongoing battle between transparency and government secrecy in matters related to UAPs and UFO research in relation to this CRADA. Each document obtained adds another piece to the puzzle, but the full picture of what the Army and TTSA discovered remains elusive. The Black Vault negotiated a rolling release with the Army, and the first package was released on October 23, 2024. It is unclear how much more information will be released, and when, but the Army has assured The Black Vault it continues to process the records as quickly as possible. This page will be updated as those additional releases are received.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/army-and-to-the-stars-academy-of-arts-science-unveiling-the-secrecy-behind-the-ufo-material-testing-agreement/"
"Heavily Redacted UAP Briefing Between UAP Task Force and NASA Released";"2024-10-10";"A recent release of documents obtained through two Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests filed by The Black Vault in 2021 and 2022, has shed light on a briefing about Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (now referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena [UAP]) by the UAP Task Force (UAPTF) for NASA. The UAPTF was a U.S. Department of Defense program established to investigate UAP reports, running from 2020 until its transition to the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG) in 2021.Continue scrolling for more... The requests specifically asked for all communications, emails or otherwise, between the UAP Task Force, and NASA, after it was revealed in NASA FOIA Case 21-HQ-F-00507 that the UAPTF had requested NASA brief them on UAPs in September 2020. That case sought all communications between the task force and NASA. A second case was filed in 2022 to specifically request a classified slide deck on Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP), created by Jay Stratton, that was shown to NASA and likely other agencies in October of 2020 also revealed by previously released documents. These newly released records, sent by the U.S. Navy to The Black Vault, include a heavily redacted slide deck which provides a glimpse into that briefing. Previously released documents confirm that International Space Station (ISS) Program Manager, Joel Montalbano Director of the Export Control and Interagency Liaison Division, Margaret Kieffer Former Associate Administrator for Legislative Affairs, Suzanne Gillen and Former Acting Associate Administrator for the Office of International and Interagency Relations, Mike Gold all attended the briefing. While much of the material from that briefing remains classified, several important details can be discerned from the slides that were included in the release. One of the main points of interest is the extensive redaction throughout the slide deck, particularly in sections that discuss photographic evidence of UAPs. Photographs were included, but nearly all of them remain classified, with the exception of one image. Another notable section discusses the use of multiple sensors in detecting UAPs. According to the slide, the UAPTF employs a combination of technologies and reporting from operators to track and analyze UAPs. This multi-sensor approach is essential for corroborating sightings and gathering reliable data, which is then shared with other U.S. government partners for further analysis. One of the slides also focuses on the November 14, 2004, Tic Tac incident involving the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group (CSG-11). The briefing describes the object as a solid white, smooth craft without any visible wings or pylons, measuring approximately 46 feet in length. Despite the event being validated by debriefs from aircrew and other personnel, the report notes that there was limited data available to conduct a thorough technical analysis at the time. A slide titled Potential Explanations presents three possible explanations for UAPs, but two of these have been redacted. The only explanation visible suggests that some UAP sightings could be attributed to unknown weather or other natural phenomena. The redaction of the other two possibilities leaves their nature unclear. As seen in the screenshots above, and the full document release below, the documents contain extensive redactions under two primary Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemptions: Exemption (b)(1) and Exemption (b)(5). Exemption (b)(1) is used to protect classified information that pertains to national defense or foreign policy, as established by an executive order. In this case, much of the redacted content, including UAP photographs and certain technical data, likely falls under this exemption due to its potential impact on national security. Exemption (b)(5) covers privileged interagency or intra-agency communications that are part of the governments deliberative process. This exemption allows the withholding of documents that reflect internal discussions, recommendations, and draft policies that are not finalized. In the context of the UAP briefing, sections regarding potential explanations for UAP sightings and internal assessments have been redacted under (b)(5), likely because they involve pre-decisional analysis or sensitive deliberations between agencies. This release, while heavily redacted, provides a rare glimpse into the collaboration between the UAP Task Force and NASA. It highlights the efforts that were made to investigate and analyze UAP sightings during the time of the task force. The redactions, particularly in areas relating to photographic evidence and potential explanations, reflect the sensitive nature of the information involved. As more documents become available, The Black Vault will continue to publish and highlight those revelations. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/heavily-redacted-uap-briefing-between-uap-task-force-and-nasa-released/"
"Government Grants FOIA Appeal Amid Ongoing AATIP and AAWSAP Controversy";"2024-09-27";"In a long-standing battle for transparency, The Black Vault has finally seen progress in a FOIA case dating back to March 2019. The original request, case 19-F-0877, sought records related to a 2009 review of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), as conducted by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) in conjunction with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The review was confirmed by James M. Kudla, a former Public Affairs Officer at the DIA, who stated on March 11, 2019, that After an OSD/DIA review in late 2009, it was determined the reports were of limited value to DIA and there was a recommendation that upon completion of the contract, the project could be transitioned to an agency or component better suited to oversee it. Continue scrolling for more... Despite this confirmation, the FOIA request hit a roadblock. In March 2024, The Black Vault received a no records response from the FOIA office, sparking an appeal. The appeal highlighted the apparent contradiction between the governments response and Kudlas statement, arguing that the confirmation of the review strongly suggested the existence of documents. Original FOIA no records response letter dated March 1, 2024 The appeal further argued that OSD and DIA have often used the terms AATIP and the Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program (AAWSAP) interchangeably, complicating the search for records. This confusion between program acronyms has been a longstanding issue, with many key figures involved in the programs offering conflicting narratives. Dr. James Lacatski, former director of AAWSAP at DIA, Dr. Hal Puthoff, former AAWSAP contractor at Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS), and Luis Elizondo, the man who claims to have run the AATIP, have all provided differing accounts of the relationship between AATIP and AAWSAP, contributing to an environment of confusion about how both programs, or the one program with a nickname, ultimately played out. The appeal cited legal precedent, referencing McGehee v. CIA, which requires agencies to conduct searches reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents. Given the interchangeable use of program names and the confirmation from the DIA, The Black Vault argued that a more thorough search was necessary. The appeal stated, Rejecting the request based on a difference in acronym would be unfair, especially considering the significant time that has elapsed since the initial request. Appeal letter dated September 26, 2024, granting a new search and remand back to the FOIA action officer On September 27, 2024, the appeal was granted. The response from the FOIA office stated, After carefully considering your appeal, and as a result of discussions between FOID personnel and this office, I am remanding your request to FOID for a further search for responsive records. If FOID locates releasable records, it will send them to you directly, subject to any applicable fees. You may appeal any future adverse determination made by FOID. The decision to remand the request acknowledges that the initial search may not have been thorough, reflecting broader issues within the governments handling of FOIA requests, including those specifically for AATIP and AAWSAP records. However, the confusion surrounding these programs extends beyond the government. Luis Elizondo, often cited in media reports about AATIP, has repeatedly contradicted himself regarding the nature of AATIP and AAWSAP and his role in both. Meanwhile, Dr. Hal Puthoff has stated that AATIP was merely a nickname for AAWSAP, further muddying the waters by displaying that those who directly worked within these programs do not agree with each other on many of the details. These conflicting statements from former government officials have fueled controversy and speculation about the true nature of AATIP and AAWSAP. While some, like Elizondo, assert clear distinctions between the programs, others blur the lines, leaving researchers and journalists struggling to piece together an accurate account. This has inadvertently played into the hands of the FOIA offices, allowing them to deny requests on technical grounds which further complicates public understanding. The confusion between AATIP and AAWSAPwhether intentional or inadvertenthas become a tool for denial and obfuscation, with both the government and former insiders contributing to an apparent mess of a narrative. ### Follow The Black Vault on Social Media:";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/government-grants-foia-appeal-amid-ongoing-aatip-and-aawsap-controversy/"
"NOAA Releases UAP-Related Correspondence";"2024-09-26";"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released a set of documents related to the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) Task Force (UAPTF) and the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) following a FOIA request from The Black Vault. The request, filed on April 15, 2024, sought all records concerning NOAAs policies and procedures for sharing information with AARO, including any classified or unclassified documents, memorandums, or agreements dated from 2018 onward. NOAAs initial response indicated that no records were found directly responsive to the FOIA request. Despite this, NOAA took an unusual step by providing previously released correspondence involving AARO and the UAPTF, demonstrating a rare level of agency cooperation with FOIA requesters. In their response letter, NOAA stated, After searching our files, we were unable to locate records that are responsive to your request. However, we do have previously released records containing correspondence associated with AARO and/or Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF). You can have access to them, and they are attached for convenience. It is unclear who the past FOIA requester was that received these, or if the records have ever been published before.Continue scrolling for more... The attached records offer a window into NOAAs interactions with military and intelligence agencies on matters related to UAP. One of the documents includes an invitation for AARO personnel to visit NOAAs Sterling Field Support Center. This visit was part of broader interagency efforts to coordinate on the complexities of UAP sightings. Other correspondence revealed NOAAs meetings with Navy officials during the days of the UAP Task Force, highlighting the agencys long-standing role in supporting UAP investigations. One of the more revealing elements of the release was NOAAs internal concern over the impact of amateur balloon launches on UAP data. An email from January 24, 2022, addressed the issue of sky trash, a term used by NOAA officials to describe the increasing clutter in the sky caused by various amateur balloon activities. Although STEM is a very valuable initiative, this effort is probably causing some air clutter. Sky trash is becoming a problem and probably needs to be monitored somehow, one email stated. This correspondence highlights how balloon launches, often intended for educational or amateur purposes, can complicate efforts to identify and study unexplained aerial phenomena. One slide circulated internally at NOAA highlighted the global reach of balloons, with the ability to circumnavigate the globe multiple times over. The documents also detailed the challenges NOAA faced in verifying balloon data in relation to UAP events. In a series of emails, NOAA personnel discussed the difficulties of confirming whether NOAA weather balloons were present in areas reported to have UAP sightings. One email noted, We have an upcoming meeting (May 3rd) with the Navy regarding the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force where the Navy will likely ask us to help check 200 lat/lon points to verify that an NWS weather balloon was or was not in the area. Throughout the correspondence, NOAAs emphasis on interagency collaboration was clear. The agencys willingness to host meetings, share data, and engage with military and intelligence personnel shows NOAAs proactive role in the broader effort to understand UAP. The release of these documents, although not directly responsive to the initial FOIA request, provides a detailed glimpse into NOAAs involvement with UAP investigations.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/noaa-releases-uap-related-correspondence/"
"FAA Cites National Security to Withhold UAP Communications Despite Unclassified Report";"2024-09-23";"Page from 2021 UAP Report issued by ODNI, specifically mentioning the FAA as having contributed to the report In June 2021, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was filed by The Black Vault with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under case number 2021-006688. The request, filed on June 27, 2021, sought all communications between the FAA and the UAP Task Force, as well as communications between the FAA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which contributed to the creation of the UAP report released by the ODNI in 2021. Specifically, the FOIA request aimed to uncover any input the FAA provided to the UAP Task Force, including emails, memos, letters, reports, photographs, videos, charts, graphs, PowerPoint presentations, and other related documents. The FAA took over three years to respond, issuing a formal denial on September 23, 2024. The denial cited Exemption 1 of the FOIA, which pertains to classified national security records, as the reason for withholding all requested documents. According to the FAAs response: The FOIA response letter from the FAA details their denial The FAAs response raises significant questions, given that the UAP report itself was released as an unclassified document to the public by the ODNI. Although there was a classified version of the report given to Congress, the FAAs claim that all communications, input, and related documents are classified seems contradictory to the 2021 reports public version which outlined the FAAs role in UAP research. If the FAAs contributions were entirely classified, this discrepancy is not only puzzling but also suggests that the FAAs role in the UAP Task Force may involve sensitive or high-level information that was not disclosed in the unclassified version of the report. The involvement of the FAAs Security and Hazardous Materials Safety (ASH) in UAP research or reporting is also now evident, an aspect that has not been widely recognized until now.Continue scrolling for more... The ASH is responsible for overseeing and managing the security and safety aspects of aviation within the United States, particularly focusing on hazardous materials and national security concerns. This office plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of the aviation system by enforcing regulations related to the transport of dangerous goods, implementing security measures, and responding to incidents that could pose threats to aviation safety. ASH also coordinates with other federal agencies on issues of national security, making it an integral part of the FAAs broader mission to protect the nations airspace. The denials citation of national security concerns and classified status under Executive Order 13526 reveals that the FAAs contributions included classified information deemed too sensitive for public disclosure. This revelation may underscore the FAAs deeper involvement in the UAP phenomenon, aligning the agencys role closer to those of other national security bodies, which appears to differ from the publicly stated input to the UAP effort at the time. According to the 2021 unclassified version of the UAP report: The FAAs role was discussed in the 2021 UAP Report. This was the only mention of that agency and their contributions. The Black Vault has filed an appeal challenging the FAAs refusal to release the requested documents. Additionally, a new FOIA request has been submitted, specifically targeting information from the FAAs Security and Hazardous Materials Safety (ASH) office to further explore their role in UAP-related matters. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/faa-cites-national-security-to-withhold-uap-communications-despite-unclassified-report/"

This date was stipulated since previous FOIA requests were processed for records prior to this date. There was one article that came up, circulated internally from The Guardian that caused a hit on the keyword, but this was public information. The key to this release, was a calendar invite that showed Director Bill Nelson had a meeting about UAP, organized by Special Assistant to the Administrator Kayla Ratnasamy. Also indicated by the released records, the meeting included Alyssa Bias, who appears to be a #FOIA officer with Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). No other names were connected to the invite on this release.

Congressman Tim Burchett and Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna Communications with NASA & Records Relating To Tweet Addressing NASA Backed Out of UAP Hearing NASA FOIA Case 23-00706-F-HQ Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna and Congressman Tim Burchett This particular case asked for: I respectfully request a copy of all communications between NASA and Congressman Tim Burchett (including his staff/office) and Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna (including her staff/office) about a July 2023 hearing about Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. I ask that you include all emails, letters, memos, faxes and other means of communications between all parties mentioned. Congressman Burchett has made reference to NASA backing out of their now scheduled July 26, 2023, hearing on UAP. This request, I would ask all forms of communication between the Congressman and Congresswoman, ALONG WITH, all internal emails regarding the same, be responsive to this request. When it comes to internal correspondence (or even inter-agency, if applicable) I ask that all classified and unclassified records are searched. I also ask that you include any email attachments found during the search. To further specify so documents could be located, NASA responded on Twitter to this allegation, and stated David Spergel was invited but declined. He, or the Congress(wo)mans office, likely communicated with Spergel and NASAs Office of Public Affairs to coordinate. I also ask that you include all internal communications about the tweet sent out by NASA, regarding how they wanted to respond to the allegation made by Congressman Burchett. These records are also likely in the Office of Public Affairs, specifically the person(s) who run NASAs Twitter account. No records turned up when it came to Congressman Burchett or Congresswoman Luna, or their offices, but records did turn about about NASAs tweet addressing the allegation they backed out of the UAP hearing. The records released are available below. 23-00706-F-HQ [11 Pages, 1.2MB] Dr. Daniel Evans, Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator for Research, Emails  NASA FOIA Case 22-HQ-F-00593 Dr. Daniel Evans This particular case asked for: ALL emails sent to/from, bccd or ccd, Dr. Daniel Evans, Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator for Research, which contain the following keywords: Unidentified Aerial and/or Unidentified Flying and/or UAP and/or UFO and/or Unidentified Spacecraft and/or Unidentified aircraft 22-HQ-F-00593 [187 Pages, 3.7MB] Lonnie Shekhtman Emails  NASA FOIA Case 23-00084-F-GSFC Lonnie Shekhtman This particular case asked for: All emails, with any level of classification, which contain the following keywords: Unidentified Aerial and/or Unidentified Flying and/or UAP and/or UFO and/or Unidentified Spacecraft and/or Unidentified aircraft and/or UAPTF and/or AARO and/or Anomaly Resolution PLEASE INCLUDE ALL ATTACHMENTS TO EMAILS FOUND. I ask that you search the follow e-mail boxes, with the time frames in the parentheticals:  Lonnie Shekhtman (May 1, 2018, through the date of processing this request) You may omit any newspaper articles that are publicly available, which do NOT contain commentary. Should the email have additional commentary including a newspaper, I ask that you please include those as responsive to this request. Ms. Shekhtman is a senior science writer for NASA. During the FOIA case negotiation, The Black Vault excluded Anomaly Resolution given the broad nature of the term. The remaining keywords were search and records released. 23-00084-F-GSFC [347 Pages, 13MB] 23-00599-F-GSFC [14 Pages, 1.1MB]  A second request was filed to get additional records after the first request above. Enigma Labs & NASA Communications NASA FOIA Case 23-00245-F-HQ Enigma Labs This particular case asked for:  a copy of all communications, whether through email, mail, fax, or otherwise, between NASA and the company Enigma Labs, with a web address of https://enigmalabs.io/. To help round down the scope of records sought, this company has claimed collaboration between NASA and themselves, on the UAP issue. With NASAs current UAP investigation, I believe that should help zero in on where the responsive records would be located. I ask that you release all communications sent to/from (or ccd/bccd NASA) between your agency and Enigma Labs. I ask that all attachments found on those emails, be included as responsive to this request, whether they be PowerPoint presentations, photos, videos, or whatever other format that may be attached. 23-00245-F-HQ [20 Pages, 0.8MB] One page from the above request was referred to the DoD for processing. That was eventually released, and revealed as an invitation for a Zoom or phone call. Given the scope of the request, the date of October 18, 2022, likely was a meeting between Enigma Labs and Sean Kirkpatrick of AARO. 23-F-1040 [3 Pages, 0.6MB] Senior Advisor to the NASA Administrator Randy Cruz  NASA FOIA Case 22-HQ-F-00140 Randy Cruz NASA FOIA Case 22-HQ-F-00140 asked for the following:  emails sent to or from, bccd or ccd, Senior Advisor to the NASA Administrator Randy Cruz which contain the following keywords: Unidentified Aerial and/or, Unidentified Flying and/or, UAP and/or, UFO and/or, Unidentified Spacecraft and/or, Unidentified aircraft and/or, UAPTF dated 8/01/2018 to 07/31/2021. The request yielded more than 1,100 pages of material. After the first release, the case was closed with 247 pages being referred to the Department of Navy for review and release. That case is still ongoing. Release #1 [1,135 Pages, 3.6MB]  Note: There are many NASA Morning Briefing emails in this release, which in part, will be unresponsive to this request. However, there are still many gems hidden throughout, including one never-before-heard-of event, seen below. Release #2 [129 Pages, 1.8MB]  These records were released by the Department of the Navy on September 17, 2024. These were the referred pages from NASA to the Navy, which should have totaled 247 pages, as noted in Release #1 above. However, the Navy responded stating NASA supplied only 127 pages. An appeal has been filed. Extreme Acceleration by UAPs Event One particular revelation from the above release, was the discovery of an October 6, 2020, virtual event with the title, Extreme Acceleration by UAPs. It was said to be a presentation given by Robert Powell, founder of the Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies (SCU), along with Christopher Mellon, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, delivering introductory remarks. At first glance, it appeared to may be just an event held by SCU, and Michael Gold, Former Associate Administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships, was sent an unsolicited invitation. However, at closer glance, you can see that Gold received the invitation from a Rich Coleman, and in the signature line, he signed it as the President of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Association. Gold then sent it to Randy Cruz, Senior Advisor to the NASA Administrator, saying I just got this but FYI if youre interested in attending When researching this Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Association group, nothing is really found that connects to this group online nor are there any references to it. However, Richard Coleman, along with Alexandra Hale who also appeared in the signature block as the Vice President of the group, do run an organization known as the Space Transportation Association (STA) with the same titles. According to their website, the STA is dedicated to supporting policies that advance robust, affordable space transportation for NASA, DOD, and commercial markets. There is no contact information on STAs website, but The Black Vault reached out to Powell and Mellon for comment on the 2020 event. According to Powell, this was not a public event. In addition, he said , There were 41 people at the presentation, but declined to name any who attended nor would confirm if they were from the government or military. The only information he gave on the attendees was that they were not from the world of ufology. When Mellon was asked by The Black Vault for comment, only minimal information was received in return. The first response was that his plans changed insinuating that he did not attend the event. He also called the document a nothing burger. The Black Vault followed up to confirm that he definitely did not attend, and if the introductory remarks were given by someone else, but Mellon only responded with, not ringing a bell. Powell was asked to confirm Mellons attendance, but declined to answer. NASA was also asked by The Black Vault on whether their personnel attended on official business, but they declined to comment stating that Gold, Cruz and NASA Director at the time James Bridenstine no longer were at the agency, and they would need to be contacted directly for confirmation. Attempts were made to contact the three individuals, but as of the writing of this article, no responses were received. Christy Hansen, Goddard Airborne Sciences Manager Emails  NASA FOIA Case 23-00082-F-GSFC Christy Hansen, Goddard Airborne Sciences Manager NASA FOIA Case 23-00082-F-GSFC asked for the following: ALL emails, with any level of classification, which contain the following keywords: Unidentified Aerial and/or Unidentified Flying and/or UAP and/or UFO and/or Unidentified Spacecraft and/or Unidentified aircraft and/or UAPTF and/or AARO and/or Anomaly Resolution PLEASE INCLUDE ALL ATTACHMENTS TO EMAILS FOUND. I ask that you search the follow e-mail boxes, with the time frames in the parentheticals:  Christy Hansen, Goddard Airborne Sciences Manager (January 1, 2016, through the date of processing this request) This request was stemmed from a discovery above about NASAs balloon program, and how the NRO was seeking out possible culprits to UFO Sightings they were receiving from pilots encountering balloons. 23-00082-F-GSFC [41Pages, 4.2MB] I wrote a thread on X about this, as well, that may be of interest: 1/ This seems trendy again given the connection some are making between the UAP issue & the recent Chinese ""spy balloon"" event.

"AAROs UFO Research Portal Shrouded in SecrecyFOIA Release Offers Little Insight";"2024-09-06";"In a recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) release to The Black Vault, through FOIA Case 23-F-0740, the Department of Defense (DoD) provided documents regarding their classified web portal for their UFO research office known as the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This request was based on the testimony given by Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, the current Director of AARO, during the April 19, 2023, hearing on UAP. Dr. Kirkpatrick stated during his testimony, Once we have an approved web portal to hang the unclassified stuff, we will do, you know, we would downgrade and declassified things and put it out there. In the meantime, were putting a lot of these on our classified web portal, where we can then collaborate with the rest of the community so they can see whats going on. Following this, The Black Vault filed a FOIA on April 25, 2023, requesting a copy of the main page for this classified portal, and, a copy of all pages one click down from the main page, which would be a copy of every page directly linked to that home page by one click.Continue scrolling for more... The response received from the DoD were two images and are of very low quality, with much of the text unreadable. Additionally, substantial portions of the documents are redacted, marked with the familiar (b)(1) exemption, often used to protect classified information. The pages released are: Page 1 Page 2 Redaction Explanation The Department of Defense explained these extensive redactions with the following: The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security (OUSD(I&S)), a component of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, conducted a search of their records systems and located [#] (sic) pages determined to be responsive to your request. The IDA, in their capacity as an Initial Denial Authority, has determined that portions of the two responsive pages are exempt from release. The exemptions are made pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  552 (b)(1), which allows information to be withheld if it is classified in the interest of national security. Specifically, the classified information falls under the protection of Executive Order 13526, Sections 1.4(a), (c), and (g), covering military plans, intelligence activities, and vulnerabilities related to national security. Additionally, the unclassified portions of the document are also being withheld due to concerns that, when compiled together, they could reveal classified information under Section 1.7(e) of E.O. 13526. This exemption covers compilations of unclassified material that reveal a classified association or relationship. The concern is that even the unclassified information, when reviewed together, could inadvertently disclose details that remain sensitive and critical to national security. The poor quality of the images and the extent of the redactions leave much to be desired. The FOIA request aimed to shed light on the classified web portal Dr. Kirkpatrick referenced in his testimony, but the response offers little insight into its contents. An appeal will be filed to fight the low quality imagery, in addition to the redactions. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/aaros-ufo-research-portal-shrouded-in-secrecy-foia-release-offers-little-insight/"
"AATIP Memo Unveiled After FOIA Battle: DoD Inconsistencies Exposed";"2024-08-23";"Note and Update 8/23/24 @ 4:55p Pacific time: Hours after the publication of this article, the Pentagon responded with comment. The article has been updated to reflect those answers, which are added in BLUE. Luis Elizondo After years of bureaucratic obstacles and inconsistent responses, The Black Vault has obtained a highly sought after document through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) that directly references the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), reported since 2017 as The Pentagons Secret Search for UFOs. The draft memo, never-before-seen by the public and authored by former DoD counterintelligence agent Luis Elizondo, details AATIPs mission as focusing on beyond next generation technologies in the areas of lift, propulsion, cloaking, and human effects, and describes how AATIP was gathering information on unexplained or unknown aerial systems from various DoD components and elements. But more importantly to some, it may even confirm Elizondos official work within the program, a claim denied by the Pentagon since 2019.Continue scrolling for more... Neill Tipton The journey to obtain these records began on May 5, 2021, when The Black Vault filed FOIA case 21-F-0964. The request specifically sought communications between Elizondo and Neill Tipton, a senior DoD official that was also one of three named individuals in Elizondos DoD Inspector General (IG) complaint filed on May 3, 2021. This complaint alleged that all three (Tipton, Pentagon Spokesperson Susan Gough and former Director for Defense Intelligence [Intelligence and Security] Garry Reid) conducted retribution and provided false information to the public, and were also accused by Elizondo of abusing government authority and illegal destruction of information. This complaint stemmed from Elizondos belief that he was being mistreated after his resignation from the Pentagon due to his decision to speak about his time investigating UFOs, now being referred to as Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP). After amending the FOIA request to focus only on emails between Elizondo and Tipton containing keywords such as unidentified, AATIP, and UAP, (and others) in response to the DoDs request to narrow the search scope, the DoD initially replied in December 2021, stating that no records were found. A portion of the original FOIA response from December 14, 2021, which stated that no records could be found, as requested. Believing differently, The Black Vault filed an appeal within one day, asserting that responsive documents existed. This assertion was based on knowledge gained from various sources and research means during the timeframe leading up to the case filing. The information learned through this process, combined with the specific keywords provided for the FOIA request along with the date range requested for the search (2008  2017), left little to no doubt that responsive records existed. September 25, 2017, at 11:23a, Mr. Luis Elizondo sent an e-mail to Mr. Neill Tipton which included the AATIP acronym in the body, the appeal stated. This fact alone should have yielded at least one responsive document to the request, which was used as the basis of the appeal. The appeal letter filed by The Black Vault went on to further express deep frustration with the FOIA process, the DoD, and their handling of cases related to AATIP and Elizondo, stating: Let me add within the body of this appeal, on how frustrating some of these requests are getting. I believe, and hope, your office has seen the lengths Ive gone to try and make your efforts easier by closing / withdrawing requests, to reduce paperwork etc. I am also always there, when possible, to amend requests to also lessen the burden of a workload. However, as you can see with this case alone (and now many others), cases are having me reduce the scope to help, but after months (and sometimes years) of waiting, they are inappropriately closed, and I have to then go through the lengthy appeal process. There are NUMEROUS agencies that I can cite, where requests are processed for communications between two people, without stipulating a keyword search. I am sure a keyword reduction in scope helps, but as we can see here, that is likely creating more problems generating more paperwork and wasting more time than it is actually helping. The appeal was also ccd electronically to the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS), which acts as a mediator between FOIA requesters and federal agencies, helping to resolve disputes and ensure proper handling of FOIA requests. The appeal was ultimately granted in February 2022, and the case was remanded back to the DoD for further processing. Despite this, The Black Vault never received an acknowledgment that the case had been reopened, as required by law. When The Black Vault inquired about the status in August 2023, a year and a half after the case should have been reopened and acknowledged, the DoD responded that an acknowledgment letter had not been sent as it was overlooked. Although it was then sent that day, and the case was renumbered as 21-FR-0964 due to the remand, there was no estimated date of completion given. In a puzzling sequence of events that followed, the documents related to FOIA case 21-FR-0964 were later allegedly released on March 29, 2024. But yet again, The Black Vault never received that correspondence, either, and no explanation was given as to why that was by the writing of this article. The results of that case, once the documents were finally received just this week, in a moment. For an unknown reason, the DoD redacted a reference to AATIP in May 2024, which appeared in a letter that had already long been in the public domain. Further to that, the exemption cited that justified the redaction through FOIA, which is known as the deliberative process exemption (b)(5), seemed to be legally questionable. But first, it turned out that the same documents requested in 21-FR-0964 happened to turn up and were released in May 2024 under FOIA case 21-F-1154, but they had extensive redactions. This case was originally filed by The Black Vault in June 2021. These redactions included the complete blacking out of a crucial memo on AATIP which was attached to one of the emails written by Elizondo that was released in that case. In addition, another reference to AATIP in one of the emails was also mysteriously redacted, even though it had already been published unofficially and was available in the public domain through Elizondos IG complaint about 2 years prior and a portion of the same referenced in Popular Mechanics another 2 years prior to that. These actions further complicated the DoDs already questionable handling of these types of requests. The DoD had claimed FOIAs deliberative process exemption known as (b)(5) to justify the redactions of AATIP related material, despite some of it already being available in the public domain for years. From a legal standpoint, The Black Vault felt none of these actions were justified, and an appeal was filed. As of the writing of this article, that appeal remains open. This was all reported by The Black Vault on May 13, 2024. Now back to FOIA case 21-FR-0964. This week, sparked by the release of Elizondos new book Imminent which contains numerous references to Tipton, a follow up was sent by The Black Vault regarding FOIA case 21-FR-0964 to check on the status. Although no explanation was given, the same day the follow up was sent, the FOIA case officer emailed the final FOIA response letter that was dated March 29, 2024, nearly 5 months ago an email thread between Elizondo and Tipton about responsibilities for AATIP being transferred between the two gentlemen which mysteriously had redactions lifted contrary to FOIA case 21-F-1154 and the AATIP memo that The Black Vault was fighting for through appeal on FOIA case 21-F-1154, which now appeared nearly entirely unredacted. The documents, which were first denied by the DoD to even exist three years ago, were now found. As of the writing of this article, no explanation as to either why the DoD never found them, or why they were not truthful in their 2021 response to The Black Vault, has been given. 21-FR-0964 Release of the AATIP Memo  Release on March 29, 2024. Received August 21, 2024. 21-F-1154 Release of the AATIP Memo  Released and received May 13, 2024. This AATIP memo, never-before-seen by the public until now, was originally drafted in 2017 by Elizondo in hopes that it would be later issued by then Deputy Secretary of Defense (DepSecDef) Patrick M. Shanahan. It confirms the existence of AATIP and the scope of the program. The memo states that AATIP was a program with a strategic focus on beyond next generation technologies in the areas of lift, propulsion, cloaking, and human effects, and sought unexplained or unknown aerial systems information from all DoD elements for the purposes of intelligence analysis and exploitation. The memo states that the DoD continues to consider AATIP a priority, especially given recent advancements with Unmanned Aerial Surveillance (UAS) platforms that are becoming widely available. Further to that, it states that OUSDI has a demonstrated interest for any and all reporting involving anomalous UAS threats and it goes on to order that all DoD elements are hereby required to provide a courtesy copy of any data and information obtained from the field that related to unexplained or unknown aerial systems to the Director of Defense Intelligence for Technical Collection and Special Programs. That position was held by Neill Tipton, and this memorandum, if officially issued by the DepSecDef department-wide, would ultimately make Tiptons desk the central point of information related to AATIP once information was received from DoD elements. Although it does not reference UAP or UFOs specifically, the mention of unexplained or unknown aerial systems and anomalous UAS threats makes it the first official DoD document of its kind to connect AATIP to such a mission investigating unexplained objects. In addition to giving a rundown of AATIPs scope and mission, the existence of this memo may also directly contradict the DoDs ongoing assertions that Elizondo had no official role in the program. This has been a claim by the Pentagon that has fueled much controversy that has lasted for years. Could the revelations within the memo have played a role in why the DoD wanted to deny the memos existence three years ago? Or, was this truly an administrative oversight, and the documents were simply overlooked similar to how the DoD failed to send an acknowledgement letter once the case was remanded back to them that sought it in the first place? Regardless of why this memo was not discovered and denied to exist in 2021, it likely wont settle the debate about Elizondos claimed leadership of AATIP or the stated objectives of AATIP once and for all. For some, this memo will absolutely be viewed as a pivotal piece of evidence in the ongoing debate over AATIPs scope and Elizondos involvement. To them, this will serve as undeniable proof, if they even felt undeniable proof wasnt already out there to begin with. To others, the release of this may simply be seen as a draft memorandum that was authored by Elizondo, without definitively proving his leadership or directorship of a funded UFO program known as AATIP, and in the end, to them, it will prove nothing. This juxtaposition is a true testament to the divide between skeptics and believers in todays conversation about the UFO topic. But even as early as just days ago, the DoD still continues to deny Elizondos official involvement in AATIP  a claim Elizondo still strongly disputes. However, that was prior to the DoD releasing and the public seeing this memorandum. So, The Black Vault reached out to the Pentagon for comment. How does this not contradict the DoDs stance on Luis Elizondo, and the denial of his official responsibilities on AATIP? Why would he be drafting such a memorandum if AATIP had long been cancelled (per DoD), and that he had no official responsibilities on it (per DoD)?, the first question asked. After publication of this article, Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough submitted comment by stating, Luis Elizondo had no assigned responsibilities for AATIP. As noted in the Historical Record Report Volume 1, available on www.aaro.mil, AATIP was never an official, recognized DoD program. The draft, unsigned memo for the record that you reference was crafted by Mr. Elizondo and appears to have been unsolicited. Given the opportunity to respond to the above, Elizondo added, The memo they claim was unsolicited was in fact a request by none other than the Secretarys front office staff. Not only is the DoD spokesperson wrong, but any due diligence on their part would have illustrated this. This is yet another sad attempt to once again deceive the American people by a select few in the Pentagons PAO. Unfortunately, this type of behavior conducted by a few bad faith individuals, only further damages the credibility of an organization who has very little credibility left to offer. The sad truth is that this type of behavior reflects poorly on the entire Pentagon, including the majority who are patriotic, loyal, and selfless. Fortunately, the truth always comes out as it always has. Per the official document release, Luis Elizondo notated that the draft memorandum was created per the Front Office Guidance to both he and Neill Tipton. In response, Tipton never expressed disagreement with that assertion, or questioned why Elizondo was submitting an unsolicited memorandum as the DoD public affairs has labeled it. Rather, Tipton appeared to be expecting it, and was going to return thoughts once he read it per his October 3, 2017, email above. This was followed up by, Why would the DoD tell me [this memo] didnt exist, but I later would be successful getting it after an appeal from the same office that denied it existed in the first place? After publication of this article, Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough submitted comment by stating, As indicated in the response letter to you dated December 14, 2021, regarding 21-F-0964, the initial FOIA search did not yield responsive records. Given the opportunity to respond to the above, Elizondo added, This response isnt even worthy or a response. Its clear that obfuscation and deceit is the new norm for the same few at the PAO office. I would once again remind them that propaganda and disinformation against the American public is illegal. Elizondo also provided the following written statement to the Black Vault about this release, which underscores his thoughts about the importance of it all: Thanks to The Black Vaults continued pursuit of the facts, the DoD had no choice but to relent and admit the obvious. 1) AATIP was a real program and funded. 2) My former employer, the OUSD(I) has had, and currently has a keen interest in AATIP and the UAP topic. 3) There remains a clear national security nexus as it relates to UAP. My fear is that unless more people demand the truth, this information which many of us already knew, would never see the light of day and remain hidden from the public. An excellent example of The Black Vault not taking no for an answer. As the controversy surrounding AATIP will undoubtedly continue, The Black Vault remains committed to bringing the truth to light, whatever that may be, despite the challenges posed by the DoDs problematic FOIA process. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/aatip-memo-unveiled-after-foia-battle-dod-inconsistencies-exposed/"
"Project Blue Book: Ramstein Air Force Base UFO Encounter, March 26, 1962 (Unidentified)";"2024-08-07";"Background On March 26, 1962, at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, a significant UFO sighting was reported. The observation involved one witness. Key Details: Location: Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Date and Time: March 26, 1962. Duration: The observation lasted approximately 5 to 8 seconds. Number of Objects: One object was observed. Description of the Object: The object was initially seen as a small delta-shaped wing resembling a fighter aircraft. As it approached, it was described as less of a delta shape and more of a dart-shaped missile-like appearance, changing shape and showing no visible means of propulsion. The object exhibited fast movement, estimated at approximately Mach 2.Continue scrolling for more... Witness Accounts: The pilot reported the object first appearing at the 8 oclock position and exhibiting bright flashes. As it approached 3 oclock position, the shape shifted from a delta wing to a dart target appearance. The object traveled from the three to five oclock positions, with the pilot noting the shape change and a significant speed. Conclusion: The Project Blue Book record card indicates that the data was insufficient for a definitive evaluation. The phenomenon was marked as unidentified due to the lack of concrete data and the unusual characteristics of the sighting that did not match any known aircraft or meteorological phenomenon. This summary is based on the official case files from Project Blue Book, available for download below.";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/project-blue-book-ramstein-air-force-base-ufo-encounter-march-26-1962-unidentified/"
"U.S. Marine Corps Releases UAP Information Sharing Policy to The Black Vault";"2024-07-25";"The U.S. Navy / U.S. Marine Corps has released its policy and procedure for sharing UAP-related information with the Department of Defenses All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This release follows a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by The Black Vault on April 14, 2024, and is similar to a different directive previously released to Mr. Douglas Dean Johnson in March 2024 by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The FOIA request sought a copy of records (which includes videos/photos), electronic or otherwise, of all records that pertain to your agencys policy and procedure on sharing information with the DoDs All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO). This included all policy, procedure, memorandum of understanding, memorandum of agreement, letters, other memos, etc., outlining the Navys policy on sharing information at any classification level with the AARO. The request also asked for any procedures adopted from prior efforts such as the UAP Task Force and the Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG). Continue scrolling for more... The newly released document from the U.S. Marine Corps, dated December 8, 2023, provides guidance specific to the Marine Corps while aligning with the previously released Joint Chiefs directive from May 2023. The following are some key differences and updates. The directive provided to Johnson emphasized the role of various combatant commands and services in reporting UAP incidents, requiring standardized reporting templates and transfer of data and materials to AARO. The Marine Corps document reiterates these requirements but provides more detailed guidance specific to the Marine Corps. It mandates an OPREP-3 Special Incident Report (SIR) for any UAP incident, regardless of mission impacts. The OPREP-3 SIR is a report used within the U.S. military to provide immediate notification of any significant incident that could attract national-level interest or affect national security. The OPREP-3 SIR ensures that high-level leadership are promptly informed about incidents that have substantial implications. In the context of UAP reporting, an OPREP-3 SIR is required for any UAP incident, regardless of mission impacts, to ensure timely and accurate reporting and facilitate appropriate responses. The updated Marine Corps document also includes specific templates for reporting UAP incidents, data transfer, and material disposition, offering more detail geared towards Marine Corps implementation. These are also similar to the directive previously released. Lastly, both documents stress the importance of notifying counterintelligence elements about UAP events. The Marine Corps document specifies that the Marine Corps Operations Center (MCOC) will notify the services counterintelligence element within the Deputy Commandant for Information about all UAP-related events. While the document closely aligns with the previously released directive to Johnson, it incorporates detailed guidance tailored to the Marine Corps, highlighting the evolving nature of UAP reporting protocols and the emphasis on inter-agency coordination and information sharing. The Black Vault has targeted nearly every military branch and agency that may share information with AARO, seeking out policy and procedure documentation. While some responses thus far have yielded a no records response (which will be reported on later), others are still being processed, indicating there may be responsive records still to come to light. Additional releases will be published as they become available. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/u-s-marine-corps-releases-uap-information-sharing-policy-to-the-black-vault/"
"ODNI Issues Rare GLOMAR Response to FOIA Request on Five Eyes Alliance UAP-Related Emails";"2024-07-18";"Brian D. Fishpaugh In a recent FOIA release profiled on The Black Vault, researcher Grant Lavac discovered an email referencing the UAP Caucus Working Group. Within this email, a long list of redactions hid every recipient of the message, except one: Brian D. Fishpaugh. This revelation prompted a targeted FOIA request by The Black Vault aimed at uncovering any potential communication related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) within Fishpaughs email records. Fishpaugh, who serves as the Deputy National Intelligence Manager for Aviation (NIM-A) within the ODNI, became the focal point of FOIA case DF-2024-00285. The request, filed on June 18, 2024, by The Black Vault, sought emails from Fishpaughs inbox that contained various UAP and UFO related keywords, along with those mentioning named individuals (which included alleged UFO whistleblowers) connected to the topic. FOIA document received by researcher Grant Lavac which revealed Brian D. Fishpaughs name. It is unclear why his was the only that was not redacted. The objective was to uncover any communication that could shed light on the collaboration and research efforts within the Five Eyes alliance regarding UAPs, or the UAP issue as a whole.Continue scrolling for more... To provide some additional background on Fishpaughs role at ODNI, he was asked to do a presentation at the Counter UAS Technology USA conference in early December 2023. As the Deputy National Intelligence Manager for Aviation, he focused on Ensuring decision advantage and promulgating strategic guidance to secure the air domain during his talk. His presentation covered a strategic outlook on pacing threats in the short-to-mid-term, the current posture of US government solutions to counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS), and future efforts to further C-UAS strategies. However, the FOIA response from the ODNI, dated July 18, 2024, produced an unexpected result just one month after it was filed. Instead of a standard release of email records (which are sometimes redacted), or a straightforward full denial due to national security reasons the ODNI issued what is known as a GLOMAR response. The term GLOMAR originates from the Glomar Explorer, a CIA vessel involved in a covert operation in the 1970s. A GLOMAR response essentially means that the agency can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the requested records. This type of response is rare and typically reserved for highly sensitive matters. FOIA response letter The letter from the ODNI stated: This letter responds to your Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests received on June 18, 2024, by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), relating to Brian Fishpaugh. This request was processed under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C.  552, as amended. ODNI neither confirms nor denies the existence or nonexistence of the requested records. The fact of the existence or nonexistence of requested records is protected from disclosure pursuant to Section 102A of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C.  3024(m). Therefore, this request is denied pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3). FOIA exemption (b)(3) permits the withholding of information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute. In this case, the National Security Act of 1947 was cited, indicating that the requested records, if they exist, are considered highly sensitive and integral to national security. Numerous agencies, including numerous military branches within the Department of Defense (DoD) along with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and others, all have processed similar FOIA requests related to UAPs without resorting to GLOMAR responses. These agencies have searched email boxes for the exact same keywords without invoking a GLOMAR, but in some cases, have denied records in full for national security reasons. In other cases, partially redacted or completed unredacted records are released. Either way, agencies generally will process the request, and not issue a GLOMAR response. What information related to UAPs could be so sensitive that it warrants such a response from ODNI? Why was Fishpaughs name the only unredacted in the past FOIA release, indicating his connection to UAP is openly acknowledged by the U.S. government, yet responsive material can neither be confirmed nor denied that it exists? The refusal to even acknowledge the existence of these records suggests that there may be significant developments or classified activities related to UAP research and collaboration within the Five Eyes alliance or the ODNI. The request will be appealed by The Black Vault. When those results are available, they will be posted in a future article. ### Follow The Black Vault on Social Media:";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/odni-issues-rare-glomar-response-to-foia-request-on-five-eyes-alliance-uap-related-emails/"
"AARO Releases Findings on Suspected Extraterrestrial Alloy";"2024-07-11";"The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) published two reports detailing the analysis of a magnesium alloy specimen that has been the subject of much speculation. The specimen, purportedly recovered from a crashed extraterrestrial vehicle in 1947, has been alleged to exhibit extraordinary properties, including functioning as a terahertz waveguide and generating antigravity capabilities. In 2022, AARO contracted Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct a thorough investigation into the specimens origins and properties. According to AAROs summary on their website, In 2022, The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) contracted with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to conduct materials testing on a magnesium (Mg) alloy specimen. This specimen has been publicly alleged to be a component recovered from a crashed extraterrestrial vehicle in 1947, and purportedly exhibits extraordinary properties, such as functioning as a terahertz waveguide to generate antigravity capabilities. In April 2024, ORNL produced a summary of findings documenting the laboratorys methodology to assess this specimens elemental and structural characteristics. ORNLs investigation involved a series of advanced tests, including isotopic ratio measurements, elemental composition analysis, and structural characterization using microscopy and spectrometry techniques. The findings, as documented in the reports, indicate that the specimen is of terrestrial origin, according to ORNL. The isotopic composition of the magnesium and lead in the specimen falls within the expected values for terrestrial materials, suggesting that it is not extraterrestrial.Continue scrolling for more... ORNL assessed this specimen to be terrestrial in origin and that it does not meet the theoretical requirements to function as a terahertz (THz) waveguide, the AARO report states. The analysis revealed that the bismuth layers within the specimen were intermixed with lead, which precludes the possibility of it functioning as a waveguide. The report further explains that this specimens elemental and structural characteristics do not meet the conditions to theoretically function as a waveguide. The historical context provided by AARO adds another layer to their analysis. The characteristics of the specimen are consistent with mid-20th-century magnesium alloy research and development projects, which often involved the use of zinc, lead, and bismuth additives for various purposes, including corrosion resistance. The banding and structural features observed in the specimen align with manufacturing techniques from that era, such as vapor deposition. Despite the conclusive findings, the reports acknowledge the specimens long and debated history. While the analysis strongly supports a terrestrial origin, the exact historical origin and purpose of the specimen remain unclear due to its undocumented chain of custody and conflicting personal accounts. AAROs summary notes that the specimens delamination, oxidation, and structural characteristics are consistent with exposure to environmental and mechanical stresses over time. The reports, released by AARO, are now available for download from The Black Vault below. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/aaro-releases-findings-on-suspected-extraterrestrial-alloy/"
"Marauder Systems Role in UAP Reporting and Military Operations";"2024-06-27";"The Black Vault has uncovered information about the Air Forces Marauder system through a recent FOIA release. This system, referenced in the Unclassified Summary of Report No. DODIG-2023-109 regarding the DoDs actions on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), plays a vital role in documenting and reporting UAP incidents for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army. According to the DoD/IG report, the Air Force has designated UAP as a Special Interest Item, requiring aircrews to document and report UAP observations within 24 hours of mission completion using the Marauder system. The Army also utilizes Marauder for similar purposes, due to the lack of DoD-wide UAP-specific processes. The Marauder system is an advanced mission reporting tool used by the Air Force, Space Force, and select Joint Force partners. Integrated into the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), Marauder facilitates the secure drafting, quality control, approval, and publication of mission reports. Although not mentioned in the DoD/IGs report, it seems likely that the Space Force, and select Joint Force partners, would also use the Marauder system for UAP reporting.Continue scrolling for more... Marauders capabilities include: Drafting detailed mission reports (MISREPs) Quality control and approval pipelines to ensure report accuracy Global access to published reports Export functionality for in-depth analysis The system supports multiple domainsair, space, and ground. The air domain, Marauders most utilized, handles reports for missions flown under the Air Tasking Order. The space domain focuses on tracking satellites and space assets, while the ground domain deals with ground operations and intelligence collection. Marauder employs a structured workflow, assigning users specific roles such as Viewer, Drafter, Reviewer, and Approver, each with distinct privileges. Reports progress from draft through quality control to approval and publication, ensuring reliability and precision. One of Marauders unique features is its handling of Agile Combat Employment Reports (ACEREPs), which streamline reporting in high-tempo, resource-constrained environments by bypassing traditional quality control and approval steps. The newly released documents show how reports could be displayed within the MARAUDER system. The document obtained also highlights ongoing updates to Marauder, reflecting the systems continuous evolution to meet the dynamic needs of military operations. This is facilitated by initiatives like Kessel Run, which revolutionizes software development and delivery for the Air Force. The Marauder system exemplifies the modern militarys reliance on advanced technology for mission reporting and intelligence gathering. Its critical role in UAP reporting and various military operations underscores its importance in maintaining national security and operational efficiency. Additional FOIA requests have been filed to uncover, specifically, how Marauder catalogs UAP related events within this sytem. That information, if or when it is released, will be published on The Black Vault. ###";"https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/marauder-systems-role-in-uap-reporting-and-military-operations/"
